That is where I draw the line at instigation. I may have unintentionally instigated the conversation, but their response, so full of vitriol was intentional and leagues more instigating. I'm not proud of stooping to their level with the \"illiterate\" comment, but I still stand by the message.

I knew she was actually terrified and had to grab her hand to give her reassurance. The operator on the phone pretty much told her she had to deliver the baby herself until the ambulance got there.\n\nShe followed everything the operator and delivered my baby boy, when My baby was out he wasn't breathing so she pretty much tore the bathroom apart looking for a nasal aspirator, by the time she got the baby to breathe again, the ems had arrived, where both me and baby were taken to the hospital. Later on when my husband arrived at the hospital the doctor told them if my step daughter hadn't come home when she did, Both me and the baby would have died.\n\nEven after both me and my baby were able to come home, my husband hadn't been able to take off time yet so my step daughter took it upon herself to cancel all plans with her friends, and look after the kids while I rested,cooked dinner and cleaned the house as well.\n\nThat and on top of all that has literally been my rock, In all honesty these 3 weeks I have gotten to know her more than in the 11 years I have been her stepmom. I have never been for thankful for what she has done.\n\nI mentioned to my husband last night I feel like she needs a gift or something to show her thankful for what she has done. Neither of us can think of anything though.. any ideas?", "id": "ibxhvi", "upvotes": 8120, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/ibxhvi/my_step_daughter_went_from_crazy_hormonal_teen_to/", "permalink": "/r/Advice/comments/ibxhvi/my_step_daughter_went_from_crazy_hormonal_teen_to/", "comments": ["Putting myself in her position, I don't think some object you buy is the right way, especially if it's make up or something like that. What she did and does is not anything money can buy, so I feel like you cannot say 'thank you' with something you just bought for money either. Also, if I was her, I would not expect or want anything in the first place.\n\nBut I understand you want to give her something. I would vote for a gift of sentimental value (so if it's jewellery, something special, e.g. with the family name in it?) and something that shows you truly appreciate the energy and time she's putting into everything. Maybe she's working and saving up for something (someone mentioned a car) - you could gift her that and say it's so she doesn't have to work for it, i.e. gets some time back for herself that she has spent doing things around the house and with the other kids?\n\nA weekend with her friends is also great as it also gives back time. \n\nI also agree with those who said you and your husband need to make sure she is ok mentally, she might not admit it as to not cause you guys more worries.", "I am a 23 year old boy so I understand I am not your target demographic here, but I did see someone else comment about asking her what she would like. \n\nAs someone who's gotten more gifts from my parents over the years of what THEY thought would be such cool, creative gifts I'd be interested in, ASK HER. Tell her you feel that she's been helping a lot, the her how much you appreciate her, and tell her you want to get her something fun as a thank you. Use some of the ideas people suggest here as suggestions for her if she doesn't know. \n\nI saw one for spa tickets or something, which would be an excellent suggestion, but without knowing if she would really WANT that... I promise you, I would have given anything for a gift card over half the shit over gotten from my parents over the years\n\nEdit: came back to say, because it was actually bothering me, PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HER ADOPTION PAPERS! What kinda crap is that? Essentially telling a teenage girl \"hey I didn't see you as mine before, but now that you've been helping out I guess you're a part of the family\"\n\nThat kind of advice makes sense to adults who can see the gesture for what it is, but are you really going to make her second guess herself over what everything BEFORE the adoption papers meant?", "Glad you and baby are doing so well. What a relief that everything happened the way it did. \n\nGive her a piece of family jewelry or something. Now is when you give her a family relic. I\u2019m a girl and something similar happened and when I was 13 my father gifted me his grandfather\u2019s pocket watch. It wasn\u2019t anything expensive or fancy, but it was grampa\u2019s. I still have that thing tightly wrapped up in the original cloth it came with and I know exactly where it is. I\u2019ll never let it go and I\u2019ll always look at it and remember the moment my dad gave it to me. We were sitting outside in the backyard, sun was shining. Such a beautiful memory.", "No matter what you decide, there is one thing that you should do. Give her a big long bear hug, say two things: (that you love her and thank you), then keep your mouth shut and just hold her in that bear hug for sixty seconds. I know sixty seconds is a long time, but it's needed to go through the stages to get true effect. You know... \"oh hug\", \"ah sweet hug\", \"umm?\", \"is this getting awkward?\", \"this is nice\", \"this person really truly loves me.\" \n\nTouch is a powerful thing. Nothing beats a long full bear hug. Especially if there has been some discord or trauma. Trying to find the right words can seem an impossible task. And sometimes, there are no right words. A long bear hug cuts through all of that to shine the light to a foundation of love. A reminder. A reconnection.\n\nIf anyone still isn't sold on the power of a long, quiet bear hug, please feel free to try it on your SOs. It doesn't need to be an SO - it could be someone that you have a relationship of mutual love. Obviously be reasonable in selecting (e.g. mutual is an essential part.) For full effect, you need to be the bear hugger. That means your arms go around their shoulders and you really hold them tight. Try to keep speaking to one sentence and then just hug for sixty seconds. It's ok to shush people and tell them to keep hugging if you need to. If they are taller than you, you can sit on their lap to bear hug them. If they are shorter, and you are physically able to, lift them a little off the ground as you bear hug them. Try this and you will see the impact. You will become a follower of the long bear hug.\n\nLastly, you can also use this technique for someone actively distraught. The goal is similar, but different. This isn't about a reconnection, but just letting that person know that they are not alone. There isn't a time limit on this one. It could be for much longer. Talking can go either way. Typically, I'd recommend keeping to talking to a minimum. Again, sometimes there are no right words. As this can go much longer than sixty seconds, it's fine to switch around the physical configuration of the hug if you need to do so to keep hugging them.", "Wow that's amazing, I would definitely recommend you write her a heartfelt letter and give it to her with the gift. That way she can re-read it for years to come. Best of luck to you and your family!", "As a 911 dispatcher... if it\u2019s possible for you, step daughter and baby to meet the dispatcher, it is a really cool experience on all sides. I\u2019ve met teenage callers and they seemed truly humbled by the experience and hearing first hand how well they did, and let\u2019s be honest; who doesn\u2019t love meeting a new little baby? It\u2019s a bit unconventional, but your step daughter will feel appreciated from multiple people. Consider taking her to dinner as an adult, you and her, or include dad if you like. A spa day for the two of you or maybe even something like a getaway for her and her friends if you\u2019re in that position (considering you just had a baby...) \n\nLong story short, just take a moment to really thank her, really recognize not only her sacrifice but her truly heroic actions. Not even adults are able to help a woman give birth especially in a breech situation, so the fact that she got this right and saved your lives is absolutely monumental and commendable. And if you can\u2019t take her to meet the dispatcher she talked to, tell her this dispatcher is exceptionally proud of her heroism.", "Maybe an heirloom or something passed down to you? Something with sentimental value. If you two are getting closer too it seems like a great time to give her something that will remain personal between the 2 of you for a long time to come! \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t ring any bells I do like the idea of a trip or try to think of something she\u2019s been talking about for a while. You could also ask her best friend if you need suggestions but want to keep it a surprise.", "Not sure if this has been mentioned or if it applies to you. You could make her godmother to your baby so she will always be his guardian angel. Also writing her a letter expressing how you feel and as an ex teen I know cash is always gratefully accepted.", "I'd say a car. Doesnt have to be new or expensive as long as it is reliable. Other than that I also support the other comments that want you to thank her. Even if she knows you are thankful and feels proud of herself, some verbal reassurance goes a long way. I know this because I wish I had some growing up.\n\nP.S. - please dont exclude your other children, include everyone and use this opportunity to strengthen your familial bonds", "You should really express this to her. Like this is so much. Of course this is all natural instinct. You gotta be fucked up in the head if you didn\u2019t want to help. Like even if she hated, she\u2019d probably help you deliver the baby instead of just let you sit there. But like of course it\u2019s still worthy for you to be unconditionally grateful, do doubt.\n\nDefinitely express this to her, because of course that it\u2019s natural for her to want to jump in an help, it totally had to stress her out big time. Like she held 2 lives in her hand, and only had the words of a 911 operator to help her through. And even helped you while your husband couldn\u2019t take time off.\n\nIf you want to give her a gift (and I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t), definitely give her options, or ask her what she wants. I would expect stuff along the lines of support in college fundings, new computer or phone, big vacation for the family, or heck, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she says that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. But nothing says lI love you\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough\u201d more then actually expressing it to her. Like implant it in her head on how she is such a wonderful human being. \n\nOne thing you\u2019ve already given her is experience too. Like know she know how to deliver a baby. Like yeah, I wouldn\u2019t recommend her someone\u2019s else\u2019s child while in a hospital, but she could be on a plane, and a woman goes into labor and theirs not doctors on board. Like imagine the story she could tell her friends now, like \u201coh what did you do over the summer SD?\u201d \u201cYeah, I delivered a fucking baby!\u201d She wants to be a medical student, bam, easy essay topic right there. So you\u2019ve already gifted her so much unintentionally, so never think anything is too small. You could gift her over the course of years. Like a reminder that you lived another year because of her. Nothing is too big, and nothing is too small. \n\nAll in all, talk with her about it. It shouldn\u2019t be a big surprise that you\u2019re gifting her, make sure you get her something she wants. Let her have time to think about it. If you feel you should give her more, you always could if you wanted. Of course don\u2019t spoil the girl, but express you\u2019ll always be thankful to have her. Like maybe gift your on your sons birthday something she likes every year, saying you\u2019ll never forget how big of a hero you are. She is an amazing young girl, and I could see why it\u2019s hard to think of what to give her as thanks. You\u2019ll always feel grateful for her, so you should always express that. Even just as words will brighten her day. It\u2019s not like the simple and casual \u201cI love you\u201d but it\u2019s a fact, that she should be proud of for as long as she lives.\n\n(Edit: ahhh, I\u2019ve been typing for so long I forgot what I wanted to close with. I\u2019m so glad you and your son are okay. That\u2019s story is amazing and it made my day 1000x better!)", "What about a necklace she can keep as a sentimental item, and write your gratitude into a card/letter.", "Do something sentimental, like write her a letter. On top of that, maybe ask her if she wants anything? Help her save for a car or college maybe?", "Anything she really likes will do. Something she's really wanted but not been able to get. Things for self-care and to help her relax. An item for her hobby. Etc. \n\nSince she's had to cancel plans with friends, maybe put aside some money so she and her friends can go out for the day?\n\nLess of a gift but more of a necessity, make sure the pair of you are okay mentally. A situation like that is bound to have an effect on you both. Make sure you and her dad leave the door open for her to talk about it.", "Idk but you should give her a family picture.it isn't a very big thing but after many years when some of you aren't around,the picture will stay with her reminding of the living moments you all spent together.\nEdit- *loving moments", "When the pandemic clears up, you could take her out to dinner at her favourite restaurant with family and/or friends and prepare a heartfelt letter that she can look back on. Being a teenager is hard so having a physical reminder of what an incredible thing she did and how much she is loved would possibly be helpful further along the line. Also I saw a comment here talking about a piece of jewellery with baby\u2019s birthday on it which I think would be lovely, does she wear a lot of jewellery? If you\u2019re going to do this as well make sure it\u2019s similar to stuff she wears, for example is she more of a necklace or bracelet person? Silver, gold, rose gold? Etc.", "The comment about asking her what she\u2019d want is the one to follow.  If she doesn\u2019t have any ideas, maybe suggest paying for a little getaway for her and her close friends (if that\u2019s something they\u2019re doing during pandemic).  I\u2019m sure she\u2019d appreciate the break, seeing her friends, and a vacation is something everyone needs.  I think also just a small reframe - I suspect that her being a literal hero and saving two lives is a co fiction and debt that could and should never be repaid.  Your gratitude and the bond between all of you as a family is the reward for that.  She\u2019ll always feel that bond, and I think honoring that at special times like your baby\u2019s birthday is enough.  The time she\u2019s spent with you afterwards, that is a different gift that you can reciprocate with something tangible.  I\u2019m not sure jewelry is something you want to give blindly; a lot of people will see it almost as a burden, that they HAVE to wear it or they\u2019re ungrateful.  If you really want to surprise her, maybe ask her friends what she\u2019d want?  But asking her is probably the best, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go well.", "As well as a physical gift,  I think something that recognises her bravery would mean so much to her. It also doesn't cost you anything.  \n\nSometimes you can write to your mayor/congressman, local person of importance and they have awards, certificates or merits that recognise acts or bravery or other achievements? \n\nAre there youth organisations locally or nationally that recognise courage and bravery like this? Your local paper? \n\nI bet she'd be so pleased to be recognised in this way. Our town has an local hero award that I nominated a friend for. \n\nAs an aside, sounds like she is coping well, but it wouldn't hurt to ask if she'd like to talk to someone like a counsellor about this, to process it.  Seeing her step mom and her sibling almost die must have been incredibly traumatic, for all involved. \n\nWishing you all the best.", "She needs to be commended for her strength, bravery, cool head under pressure, and compassion. Tell her that her actions after the birth have meant so much as well. Tell her that she is your hero and you have always been grateful to have her as part of your world, but her heroic actions proved her strength in a way you could not have anticipated. \n\nSupport her in her decisions in her upcoming future...even if you question the choices she makes. Remind yourself that she is smart, capable, and brave. Note: you can have a conversation with someone to ensure that they have considered the ramifications of their choices without condemning or condoning. \n\nI also wanted to note that while I think the idea of jewelry to commemorate the remarkable event is a good idea, I also see several suggestions that resemble mother's rings etc. Be careful that you choose something that won't make her feel awkward wearing it due to implications behind the style. Personally, I think something like three rings inside the other or interlinked would represent the interconnectedness without being overtly specific. Make sure it matches her style.", "I think something special would be a nice piece of jewelry or something with a sentimental card. For example my mom got me a Tiffany bracelet years ago that I still wear a lot, it\u2019s a simple silver bracelet with a small pink heart (and I think it was under $150). But I think a sentimental hand written card is most important! Loved reading this story, glad you and baby are okay \ud83d\udc97", "Like many others have said. I think the best gift you could give her is gratitude. Let her know how proud of her you are. I'd also encourage you to make sure she is okay mentally, that was a traumatic experience for you both and she grew up a lot in that short space of time.\n\nAside from that, spend more time with her! It sounds like you don't know her all that well so maybe organise a pamper weekend for the two of you?", "I'm seeing a lot of this like spa's, recognition awards, jewlery, ect. And while those things can be nice for some people, its not necessarily what everyone wants. I know for me personally, while I would appreciate the gesture, getting some kind of award or public recognition would make me extremely uncomfortable. I understand that its important for you to show her your gratitude, but I would reccomend giver her some say in how you do it. For example, sit down with her and talk to her. Tell her that what she did really made her a hero *to you*. Emphasize that you are recognizing her actions out of gratitude not social obligation or indebtedness. Tell her that you know it was a scary and traumatic situation and tell her that if she wants to talk to someone about it, she can always talk to you or you can help her get a few sessions of therapy. Then give her a big hug and tell her you are thankful for how helpful she has been lately and how grateful you are to be able to be a mom to her. Tell her that you would like to show her that you appreciate **her**(not what she did) and that you would like to take her out to dinner at her favorite restaurant and get her a small gift. Tell her you would like her to choose something that would make her happy and relaxed. At this point you can suggest the other things people have mentioned like a spa day, a necklace, tickets to do something fun with her friends, ect.", "Get her some jewelry from a local jeweler, OP. I\u2019m not sure your financial situation (as a jeweler maybe I\u2019m bias) but something that can last and that remind you both of what happened and how appreciative  of her. Something she can pass down to her kids sentimentally with a story!!! (P.s this story made me cry! I\u2019m glad you have someone like her in your life!!!)", "I\u2019m glad you are alive and well, and congrats on your baby, but something about this doesn\u2019t sit right with me. \n\nFirst, you describe your step daughter as a \u201ccrazy hormonal teen\u201d who is now \u201csweet loving teen\u201d after she starts paying more attention *to you*. What made her \u201ccrazy and hormonal\u201d before? \n\nCould it be that her own step mother self admittedly didn\u2019t get close to her in the ELEVEN YEARS you\u2019ve known her? \n\n>  In all honesty these 3 weeks I have gotten to know her more than in the 11 years I have been her stepmom.\n\nNow that\u2019s she useful to you she\u2019s a darling? I think it\u2019s sweet you want to get her a gift or do something, but if it took her literally saving your life to get you to notice and pay attention to her, I think I can guess why she\u2019s so \u201cmoody\u201d. \n\nThis event was probably traumatic for her, it is for the person giving birth, especially in that situation (and I\u2019m very glad you and baby are okay). She found a nearly dead woman in a pool of blood and a baby almost stopped breathing in her hands, while I assume you were screaming the whole time. You should acknowledge that this isn\u2019t a normal situation, and that it was probably very scary for her (even if it was for you, too obviously). \n\nAs other people said, you should ask her what she wants if you\u2019re willing to give her something, but I just had to comment how off this post felt.", "Using similar advice I gave another parent. Take her out maybe for a dinner or girls night out and take a moment to let her know how much you appreciate her help make it meaningful, tell her some of the stuff you shared with us, how you're happy to have gotten the time to really know here. I think more than anything hearing your love for her while spending quality time together would be a great idea.", "I feel like a physical gift is a little out of place.  Don't get me wrong, that kind of thing will happen in time as she needs/wants something.\n\nIt sounds like she really came through and matured in a time of need.  But even a brat can step up in an emergency.  It's the after care that shows how much she realized that helping others is it's own reward.  She's taking responsibility.  Just making sure she understands your thankfulness, and that you don't take her for granted is likely enough.\n\nBut as a specific way to show thanks... Maybe talk to her about being a Godsister (instead of god mother).  No real responsibility, just a reenforcement and affirmation of this new her.  More than anything I think just the talk about it will make you all cry with appreciation for each other and THAT is what will show your appreciation.  It would also go a long way to encouraging this new her to stick around.\n\nLastly, don't get mad when she stops some of the extra effort.  In the end she's still a teenager, not a parent and will want to live her life too, not just and support your life.\n\nIt sounds like you raised a good kid, despite the usual teenager things in the past.  Good job mom and dad.", "Well we don't know her as well as you got to know her. \n\nI would say something and would be *the* experience - a camping trip if she likes nature, take them to a show of their favorite artist if she likes music... it really depends on what is her thing. If it you are able to get the friends to accompany her that is better, since she cancelled plans with them, but depending on what the best gift for her would be that may not be financially possible (for example, if her big dream is travelling abroad, sending her herself would already be difficult, sending her friends along...). \n\nIt is hard to recommend a gift without knowing her hobbies, aspirations and interests.", "Hey OP,  I am an 18 year old girl who just finished my senior year. I agree with the rest of the comments that a heartfelt conversation or a sentimental gift would be most appreciated at this point. However, if you have the money for a gift, I know she would appreciate a gift as well. If you know there is something specific she has wanted for a long time, or if you just want her to pick out something nice for herself, that gesture would also mean a lot to her. A heartfelt gesture is definitely the right way to go, but depending on your stepdaughter, that gesture could absolutely come through a nice gift.", "Girls Day! Tell her to pick 2-3 of her besties, have them picked up at your place (fancy Uber) and taken for mani/pedi, lunch, shopping, Starbucks, and see if one of the other mothers will host a sleepover since it sounds like your house it full, and have pizza delivered for dinner. It is not much but it is the sentiment, and of course don't forget to tell her how much she means to you and her new baby brother.", "Lots of good suggestions already - here\u2019s my two cents on the ideas already out there. Take her out for a spa day - spend some time together, tell her all of your thoughts or give her the letter you\u2019re thinking of writing. Then take her out for a fancy dinner and give her the jewelry (if you end up finding something you\u2019d like to give her, or the marital ring you mentioned in other comments). Whatever it is, I think it should stand alone (as opposed to putting more in her college fund), and be personal in some way (spending time together, and telling her about your feelings) rather than say a gift basket or something.", "Hey op former crazy emotional teen here: \nI just want to say I think that beyond thanking your stepdaughter it might be really meaningful to actually start building a better relationship with her. Please let me explain.\n\nWhen I was a teen through young adult I had really crazy emotions due to abnormal hormone levels. I now have to take replacement medicine to manage it and to have decent quality of life. Your post reads like my mom talks. No one ever validated or helped me with my emotions as a young adult I was just told stop being so emotional and grow up. It shocked my parents whenever I stepped up reacted calm and level headed in 2 emergency situations and helped with the aftercare. To this day my mom still doesn\u2019t validate her own emotions and barely understands the impact ignoring mine had. \n\nWhat I wanted most from both incidents was someone to sincerely thank me but not act like it was a miracle I stepped up. \u201cWow I can\u2019t believe you helped out so much!\u201d Sounds to someone who has been called emotional and likely is \u201cwow I can\u2019t believe YOU...\u201d.  As far as gifts do maybe a gift maybe a gift card to a favorite coffee or candy store would be greatly appreciated. A sincere thank you and a lot more compassion and less blaming a whiny teenager moving forward would be what I wanted. \n\nPlease get better soon, and congrats on the new baby.", "Damn. She deserves all the kind words. She deserves all things. Ask people for their kind comments about what she did and compile them for her.

Also, if she's heading off to college soon she could take it along. The importance of sleep is really understated, especially someone going to college. If you're buying one anyway, buy one for yourself. You deserve it. \n\nHope this helps.", "Honestly, nothing too sentimental. There are enough memories that you don't need to give jewelry or whatever. Tell her how much you love her and thank her for being there for you and her brother.

But as soon as you can give her a break so she can be with friends the better. That'll be the best gift. It won't hurt to give her some GrubHub/Uber eats gift card so she can eat in with friends.

Furthermore, operstors first priority is gathering information. I've been part of the red cross most of my life and the more information you can give the operator the better they can prep the EMT's en route. If you know what you're doing you keep them on the phone with you and tell them and your patient what is happening to keep everyone calm. If you don't know what's happening or it's above you're expertise, the operator will instruct you on what you're supposed to be doing to prep patient for EMTs arrival.\n\nSome labour's last a week and some last half an hour.

That's a time sensitive issue, a knowledgeable professional gave instructions to her daughter who was probably just trying not to freak out and follow instructions. It would be so much worse for baby if the chord was wrapped around it's neck and stayed that way for half an hour in utero. Even if it wasn't, that baby was half way out with both mom and baby's heart rate increasing because of a stressful birth and potential blood loss for mom. That's a huge risk of septic shock for mom and without any amniotic fluid for baby things get risky. Especially if op could have potentially been there for hours. In situation where mom is high risk of septic shock, she takes priority as an already full grown human, shitty as it is. Fortunately all the cards landed correctly and baby and mom both made it but if step daughter hadn't acted, it could have been a lot worse for everyone involved.\n\nDaughter arrives home, calls 911, tells operator what is happening with ops help (given that this is clearly not her first pregnancy), operator says \"okay EMT will be with you in half an hour, here's what you have to do until they get there.\" \nIf someone lost a limb then the operator is going to tell you to tourniquet the leg over letting someone bleed out, birth is no different.\n\nMoreover, op has posted to ask what present to get her step daughter to show gratitude.

I declined, freaked out and am now leaving. My concern is for my sisters. \n\n\nMy aunt did what she said she was going to do, she barged in with 3 other people, one of them a social worker friend of hers (who was off duty) and my uncle. None of them are allowed at the house so as soon as Scott found out they were there, he called the police.  \n\nBefore the police even showed up, I told my 16 year old sister and the 14 year olds what happened. The 16 year old got angry at her dad. She was walking around the house ranting at her dad and crying. Eventually she decided to come with my aunt and I and then we would firgure out where she could go from then on. However the two 14 year olds did not believe me, they actually started laughing. Then they got angry and told me I was \u201ctrying to destroy\u201d our family and \u201chow could you make up a sick lie\u201d. It got to the point where they threw my and my 16 year sisters stuff out the window. By that time the cops came and told my aunt, uncle and the social worker they had to leave the property. \n\nThe social worker friend let the cops know everything thats been going on. The cops didn\u2019t care, they just cared about the noise and the trespassers. So I, my 16 year old sister, my aunt and uncle and their friend left. Very soon after my grandparents came and got the other three girls, after the 14 year olds called them and came to there senses.\n\nI found out my my grandma that one of the 14 year olds confronted her dad and he didn\u2019t deny anything. In fact he called me a whore and said I should\u2019ve had any problems doing what he asked.

My fianc\u00e9 never showed up to the ceremony leaving me at the altar. His friends and family tried to get a hold of him but all calls went straight to voice-mail. After waiting an hour for him I told my guests that there wasn't going to be a wedding. I opened the reception hall and told them to enjoy the food and open bar, even if there was no ceremony, I still wanted them to have a good time and enjoy the food and drinks. I tried to call him a couple of times but after 3 more failed calls I just stopped and told everyone else who were trying to get a hold of him to stop. He made it clear he didn't want anyone to get a hold of him and I wasn't going to have them waste their time.\n\n\nI didn't cry, I wasn't going to cry. At least not in front of everyone. His mother came to me and apologized through tears, she told me how disappointed she was in him and that she was so sorry. I just shook my head and stuck with her the entire time. I didn't want her to cry and feel bad for something that wasn't her fault.\n\n\nThe real MVPs were all my friends. They did their absolute best to keep things from being awkward and entertained everyone. They played music, danced and one of them went as far as going back home to bring a projector and a game system for all the kids and teens to play against each other with. I was glad that the day was somewhat saved but I still felt horrible.\u00a0My would-be BIL Ethan kept me from getting shit faced when I really wanted to, told me that it would be awkward if I did so I did my best to keep everyone happy.\n\n\nAfter 11 I told everyone who bought gifts to take them back and get their money back, a few of them refused and had me keep the gifts they got. So now I'm back at the hotel we got and I'm alone. This morning I got a couple of missed calls from my fianc\u00e9 and several messages that I haven't opened yet. I'm so angry at him, he humiliated me yesterday by not showing up when he could've told me he was getting cold feet. I had my friend message him that I want to be left alone and that if he showed up to the hotel room I was going to call my brothers to have him removed. So far he hasn't shown up but I am getting phone calls from his friends probably all wanting me to speak to him. I don't know if it's me being shallow or not but now I'm rethinking our entire relationship and whether or not I see a future with him.\u00a0\n\n\nSo another issue is that I have an extra plane ticket. It was supposed to be for our honeymoon but since the fianc\u00e9 isn't here I decided to enjoy my little getaway vacation for myself. A couple of friends are coming with me but not for another week since they gotta get childcare, put vacation time etc so they can't come since it last second. To be honest I want to invite Ethan because I've never traveled anywhere in my life. I know he's been to where I'm going and I want him to come so he can be there to show us the places to be at. Ethan told me he'd go for me but should I invite him? I asked Ethan's mom and she was all for it but I still don't know if it'll cause drama. Any advice?\u00a0\n\n\n\nUpdate\n\nOkay so I feel like I should explain more about Ethan. First I'm not going to take him. Second, I've known Ethan a little longer than my ex-fianc\u00e9.  Please believe me when I say he's a close friend of mine, both of us bonded by teasing his brother and with that we just kinda clicked and became fast friends. I wanted to take him because I didn't know how to use my ticket in the airport. I've never been traveling and I didn't want to look dumb by trying to figure it out. Thankfully, someone said what to do and I'm forever grateful so now I feel much more confident. I know it sounded iffy trying to take Ethan but honestly it was for something innocent. I see him more of a brother then anything now that I look at all the comments you guys left.\n\nAnd finally I read my ex-fiance's messages. Yes, he's alive, he wasn't in any terrible accident and the reason he never showed up was because he found out he has a kid. His childhood sweet heart came by with a kid maybe a couple of weeks ago. His best man knew and never told me because my ex didn't want him to tell me until he was 100% percent sure and I guess he found out today. He apologized so many times for not showing up but he couldn't because he felt so guilty of what? I don't know. He said a large part of him wants to make things right and take care of his son because he's always wanted a family. So screw the last 3 years right? I don't know if that means he's going to go back to his ex because he wants to talk over the phone. Honestly, I'm done. I think it's an excuse to get back with his ex, I don't believe he's ever gotten over her and her over him which is why she chose now to show herself. He sent a picture of the kid to me and I went over ex-fiance's mom's fb to see any pictures she posted of ex-fiance when he was a kid. They're low quality but there is definitely a resemblance. It feels so surreal to me, like this one big joke. I feel like I'm missing more info, like there's something else going on but I'll find out later. I haven't responded so instead I'm just going to open a bottle of wine and just get plastered.

I say go on with your life and leave him in the dust.\n\nLife is too short to dwell on the stupidities of men.", "I'd recommend giving your fiance a chance for explaining what happened. If he has some substance abuse problem, or any other illness that caused him not to show up in the wedding, you should help him in the recovery.\nOtherwise just leave him and never think about that relationship again.\nIt is ok to go with Ethan and some of your friends for the trip but don't do it just for using the ticket. If you're feeling sad, cancel the ticket, get the refund and spend some time with your family.", "Not reaching out to him is not the correct thing to do.\n\nYou cannot be petty in return.

Who\u2019s going on Reddit first thing? So many suckers for this munchaesen shit.", "Tl/Dr : you seem to be an incredible person OP, with a big heart. Remember you are surrounded by love and support. The embarrassment and shame is on him, not you. Everyone normal would be questioning the relationship after something like this. Unless he almost died, dump that man in the trash. You know what best for you, and whether you will be better off alone or with company for the first week of the trip. Whatever you decide, drink, cry, laugh, and take the most of this experience in a new place. Lastly I recommend seeing his reasons, even if you don't reply. You were about to tie the knot for forever. You deserve an understanding and closure. But still go on the trip without him. \n\nFirst and foremost OP, I'm so sorry this happened to you. You have proven yourself to be such a kind and strong person by opening up the reception hall so everyone could eat and dance, you told everyone to take back their gifts, and making sure everyone still had a good time. I wish you didn't have to find your strength this way, but I commend you nonetheless. Sending big hugs, and big kudos to your friends for stepping up and entertaining everyone. I'm so glad you have people as amazing as them in your life. \n\nI do disagree with those here saying that the family only cares for their image and that's why they did what they did on the day. Not all assholes come from a family with dirt morals. Personally, I come from a close-knit family but I have wholeheartedly disagreed with some of their choices and would be horrified if any of them did this. I can only speak from my experience, but aside from your [hopefully ex] fianc\u00e9, the family sound like good people. They seem to care about you and were devastated. \n\nI think it was good of Ethan to keep you from getting shit faced as much as you wanted to. For the sake of you not doing anything you may have regretted in the morning (I don't know how you are drunk, but mixing alcohol with that sh*t he pulled may not be best right off the bat). Obviously noone would have blamed you for it, but you were able to turn this into something everyone could still have good memories about and see how f.cking amazing you are. Trust me, noone thought he embarrassed you, they thought him to be scum. Yes his family may be embarrassed by what he did, but that doesn't mean they would maliciously deny your wants for the sake of their image. But only you know them personally, and can decide what kind of people they are. \n\nHonestly hope you enjoy the f*CK out of your trip. Its awesome of your friends to be able to come join, even if it's a week later. For the record, I do agree it will be best to see if you can take your brother's partner or change the tickets for an upgraded seat if possible. However, I see you haven't flown in an aeroplane before and Ethan knows the place you're going to, and I see no issue with taking him if you think it to be a good idea. You could do things that your friends may not be so keen to do, and just have someone to have your back while you're in a new place for the first time. I'm sure you will be able to get two single beds instead of a shared bed, and you know the kind of relationship you two have. Everyone seems to be jumping on the idea that you will sleep with each other, but not everyone is like that. If you even have an inkling or unsure about it though, don't go with him. It'll be for the best. You know yourself, and whether you will prefer company or a solo trip for the first week. This can be an incredible experience for you and the first step towards becoming more independent and trying new things.\n\nAnd seriously, anyone that has faced a sudden change or conflict in their relationship would question everything. Let alone something as massive as this. This was supposed to be the big official celebration of you two and your lives coming together, I'd call you crazy if you weren't wondering where the f*ck this came from and what it means for the future. I don't know his reasons but aside from a serious emergency, what really is there to come back to after this? He even chose the specific day. Please love yourself enough to let this man go.\n\nI will finish off by recommending you at least open the messages to read them [before you go - if you can]. You don't have to reply at all, and don't have to pick up any calls. But you were planning to become very tied up to this man for the rest of your life, you deserve to know his reasons for doing this. And perhaps a proper conversation, for some closure. I'd also recommend having someone there to support you so he can't pull any sympathy tricks and just for general support. Unless he almost died or something to that degree, leave that man in the dust. And whatever his reasons, whatever you decide to do with your relationship going forward, take the trip without him. \n\nYou deserve a break. My girl, you deserve to soak up the sun and do what you want, drink lots and cry lots and treat yourself. Check your options and do what's best for you. Take that mf trip, tourist tf out of that place. Then return and have a therapy session lined up, more if you can afford it. And figure out what path you will take going forward. Remember, none of this is on you. None of the embarrassment or shame. None of the reasons why he did this. None of the questioning reality. Do not put yourself down. Just breathe. You are incredible, and you are surrounded by people who love you. I wish you the best.", "OP, from what i could tell, u have literally no idea why he left u there? \n\nif that is case, please dont listen to the \"go fuck him, u do u, girl\" comments yet please. wait till things clear out, because nothing has been resolved yet.", "Only thing I can think of why he might do this, and hear me I'm only doing this out of curiosity and investing my time, I'm not saying what he did was right, in fact it's flat out wrong.\n\nHas something maybe happened in the past couple of days, weeks or months?

I am very sorry this happened to you. I hope things get better. For him not to tell you was the dick move here. \n\nIf he would have said something things would have been more understandable.

All he did was inflict difficulties on you, which isn't what a finance should do.\n\nI'm so sorry.", "I\u2019m so sorry he did that to you, but I also hope you enjoy your trip to Hawaii (saw the comments that said where you were going,) have a great time without that loser", "From what you have posted I will start by saying I'm sorry to hear that.

Never forget this strenght in you. And cry as much as you need, even strong people cry. So sorry for you. Go on with your life, of course you need a time for grief, but then go on. If you need, think about his poor family who need to have him in their life, and how lucky you are to not have to deal with him.", "Choosing not to attend the wedding or answer his phone because he found out he has a kid is a very, very clear indicator of how things are going to go with him. \n\nIf he was truly invested in the relationship with you, he would have told you. Hell, he would have told you when the possibility first came up.\n\nOn top of that, let's not pretend that his ex's timing was anything other than completely deliberate. That's blatantly obvious. And even if he still held a torch for her, this attempt to sabotage your wedding (or at best, a last-ditch and *way too late* plea) should have cemented the decision to stay with you rather than to go back to a relationship with someone who acts that way. \n\nHe doesn't have the guts to tell you straight out that he's not choosing you.

I had panic attacks so bad I passed out on the floor. A grown ass man. One time I was having a panic attack while driving and thought it was a heart attack so I went to the ER and even though I was not planning on hurting myself I was sent to a psych unit for a night which was basically prison\u2026. and I was once again sexually assaulted there. \n\nWhen I got out my sister told me my life was in shambled because I was jealous of her.

Hand the bottle to the security people and they will do a test to confirm it is saline.\n\nIn security, they ask you to take your shoes off, so wear shoes that are easy to take on and off, socks are a plus.  Your luggage will be x-rayed, the TSA people will tell you what to put into separate bins (electronics and small liquids).  Take all your jewelry off ahead of time and keep it in your bag.

Or a more radical example for the Christians who feel sympathy for the mom but who don't understand OP's view : imagine a Muslim burial imposed by family to a Christian person. It still would help heal the living, but it's still a complete lack of respect to the dead. Change the examples all you want, it's not because he's an atheist that suddenly he doesn't count when dead. If that would be true, there wouldn't be any need for rite in any society or community.\n\nI honestly think death is not that important, but I'd fight tooth and nails if my hardcore Atheist dad was suddenly imposed a religious funeral. Sure it's a bit for the living, but it's still the last hommage for the dead, in religious and atheist mind. It's a symbolic act, sure, in both cases.

But if there's a - even barely - tasteful moment to talk publicly, I'd tell the others of your brothers mindset, in a last hommage in his honour. \n\nBe his bro until the end in actions and thoughts and you'll feel better about it. \n\nYour mom did her part in her mind, your actions can't religiously interfere with his salvation nor hers, so any frustration has to be passing.\n\nSorry for the bad English.\n\nGood luck.\n\nEdit for clarity and some errors.", "Funerals are for the living, they say. Burying your brother in a catholic ceremony is kind of shitty, but I'd be inclined to understand it. It's what your mom needs to do for herself or whatever. Fine. Good. \n\nHowever, where she really crosses the line is how she is attempting to rewrite who your brother was. She can bury your brother catholic, but she doesn't get to pretend this is who he was. Oh, he became a covert and decided he believed all the things your mom wanted him to and wanted all the things your mom wanted for him, and only your mom witnessed it? That's convenient.\n\nAND THEN she fucking tells you that you that you can't be part of the funeral unless you accept her bullshit as truth and accept jesus into your heart or whatever. That is unforgivable. \n\nI would write her a letter. Tell her that you get why she wants to bury your brother catholic, but that you don't buy for a second that he converted. The fact that she would lie about him and who he was is disgusting to you. And the fact that she would use this occasion to cooerce you to swallow her lies and participate in her religion is absolutely abhorrent. Let her know that this has affected the way you see her and that this has damaged your relationship with her probably beyond repair. Ask her if having her way is worth losing her other son. \n\nThen, having said your peace, bury your brother. If she wants to exclude you as a pallbearer, that's her right. But I'd let that fact slip to the biggest gossip in your family. When all this is done, select someone you trust to be your power of attorney and have those papers drawn up. Because if anything were to ever happen to you, unless you are married, all of the decisions regarding your health or your arrangements will go to your mom, and she clearly cannot be trusted. ", "I'm really sorry, OP, for your loss and a lot of the responses here that compare your grief to your mother's. When my dad died my family compared my relationship with him to my mother's relationship with him. They told me that because she had been his wife longer than I had been his daughter(which is not something I have any control over) that her loss was so much greater than mine. That I would never be able to understand the depth of her grief until I had been married for 35 years and to let her have her way(we had disagreements on my father's funeral as well). I'm seeing that here from a lot of advice that losing a child is devastating to a mother more so than losing a sibling is to a brother. NO. This isn't a competition. Your loss is as great as hers and don't let anyone tell you just because she's a mother that she should be able to disrespect (either of)her son's wishes. If she really loved your brother she would respect what he wanted over what her religion dictates but that's what religion does to the priorities...God before everything and everyone else. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf it were me, I wouldn't even go to the funeral if you're uncomfortable with it and if anyone asked I would definitely tell them why. I think it would be a dishonor to your brother's memory and to your principals to attend if you both feel so strongly about religion. If you're not there you're not making a scene or disrupting anything and your mother can grieve the way she sees fit. This funeral isn't about your family, it's about saying goodbye to your brother and making sure you do that in a way that brings closure to YOU. So if a long mass with lots of words from a book that you don't identify with doesn't bring you some measure of peace and comfort--don't go. Your brother wouldn't want you to be seething with rage when really you should just be thinking about him and perhaps the good times you guys had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo matter what you choose to do, your brother died knowing that you loved him and that you respected what he wanted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "This is COMPLETELY opinion, But I hope the OP reads it. \n\nFirst, I am sorry for your loss, I also lost my brother.  Nothing helps with the feeling, NOTHING but time and even that only gives a numb bullshit feelings of \"getting over it\". Dealing with people that have clear differences of how to handle their own death, the death of a loved one and what to do after this terrible event, is yet another thing that that comes with the loss of a loved one, making the loss somehow /more/ shitty,for lack of a better term.  I hope you do find peace with it eventually, but I honestly have not and he has been gone longer than he was alive; he was 20 and passed away in 93. It gets easier, but you never \"get over it\".\n\nMy brother passed, he also was an atheists.  Being from a \"Baptist\" family, which is wildly different than Catholic, it is still religion. If you don't want conflict, I mean nothing, you have play nice and just go along. Here's why.  At the time of death of a loved one/you/everyone grieves differently.  Nothing will make you have a lasting hate/resentment more than someone crossing what you think \"should\" happen at this trying time. Now I have no idea how close you feel you were to your brother compared to how close your Mom feels she was to him.  I do believe she will likely hold it against you if you attempt to intervene. Based on experience.\n\nNOW, I am also an atheist. This is for context. Based on my life experiences I am an Agnostic atheists. I have never seen any proof or evidence to that a \"God\" does exist and I can not believe in something that has no proof. Yet I find many reasons why there surely isn't a \"God\".  I have seen things I wish I had not; been exposed to things that I wish were not even a possibility. I still have no idea if a \"God\" does/doesn't exist. I guess I feel if there is a \"God\" why does it allow the things that I have seen and experienced to happen? Why have countless people(*literally countless people) been slaughtered/tortured/slaved/maimed/born with disabilities/... this list is VERY long... in the name of a \"God\" or because it was \"God's\" will? All that and much more, yet I still admit I simply do not know.  Furthermore, I have many things I consider a blessing as well in my life, I do have an amazing life currently. But I still do not know.  I have studied the bible in the past for about 8 years (during this time I thought I absolutely believed) it was a time I was younger and less experienced than I am now. Yet, I do not know. I would have to physically see something that shadows all of my experiences and knowledge, to prove me wrong to change my mind. But I admit I could be wrong. But I do not believe .Sorry for the rant, back the the original point.\n\nIn the end, you have to make a decision if you believe he would want you to actually stand up and try to stop it. That and how you feel about what is happening. What you think he might have wanted you to do.  There is a good chance if you do try to stop it, there will be repercussions, perhaps even legally.  Again people are very strange at this kind of time in their lives. Religion is one of those things that people have a clear history of believing in absolutely, thus she perhaps feels compelled to help \"save\" him.  It could be because of family tradition/what \"should\" happen, something people tend to follow, regardless of why. I honestly don't know why, but I can assure you, if you intervene it will absolutely be a shit show.  In the end, the showing/burial/ceremony is not for the dead. I mean this. IT IS NOT FOR THE DEAD. It is for the living and saying goodbye.  Regardless of what you believe, science/religion/nothing... he has passed on to the next step of his time in the universe. We all follow this path. We are only here for a blink of eternity, so do with it the best you know how. If you truly don't want to cause any trouble, then you must do nothing.  If you feel you must do something then absolutely do it. But remember others will be affected by your actions for the remainder of your short time here.  Down the road in time, perhaps you can have a conversation about it.  Maybe not.  But in the end remember this.  You know what he wanted, what he believed, and how he felt.  Regardless of what happens from this moment moving forward, it is your memory were he lives going forward.  Let go of bullshit, but stand if you must.  I would recommend talking to the priest about it. They often have experienced this in the past and will likely be willing to talk with you and your family in regards to this. Again, I am sorry for your loss.\n\nP.S. I had to drink/or few tonight and remembered, thus prompting my response.  Sorry for spelling and grammar, but honestly it helped me get this out, so I do hope it helps someone.      \n\n ", "Sorry for your loss.\n\nI felt compelled to make my first ever post over this. \n\n\nPersonally I\u2019m agnostic, not religious at all but I understand why some people are, I\u2019ve just never found a religion that doesn\u2019t (in my opinion) try to control you with the threat of hell or judgement when you die, or doesn\u2019t seem like a cult. I\u2019m content with being the best person I can be and if I meet my maker and that\u2019s not good enough then so be it. \n\n\nI don\u2019t hate any religion however I would be unbelievably angry if I was given a religious burial. For me it would be hypocritical, I\u2019ve never voluntarily been to church or engaged in any religious activity, and the thought of having a priest or whoever talking about me in a religious way makes my skin crawl.\n\n\nI\u2019ve read comments saying a funeral is more for the living and it\u2019s more important to those grieving. In my opinion this is horse shit. I want my funeral to be the cheapest party, filled with music, motorbikes other stuff that I love. Family getting together, getting drunk, telling stories and having a good time. Ending up with me being put into a Viking boat on a lake and set on fire, I think that\u2019s the most awesome way to go but I\u2019d settle for a normal cremation.\n\n\nI attended the funeral of my best mate who was 15 when he died and it was horrible. I can\u2019t bear the thought of my closest friends and family going through what his family did on that day so I guess this experience changes my opinion on funerals. \n\n\nIf my mum \u2018found god\u2019 after I died and wanted a religious burial I\u2019d want everyone else to make a fuss and disrupt it as much as possible as sort of one last middle finger. Fuck that shit and what anyone else is feeling they\u2019ll get over it, it\u2019s not their funeral. However I\u2019d understand if they were reluctant so as to not cause more agony to my mum.  \n\nMy point is everyone is different, do what feels right. ", "*WARNING: This is one atheist writing to another about atheism. There is zero sugar-coating. I am not mincing words with euphemisms or sentimental niceties. (And OP, if you are not in a place in your grief where you can read something like that-- just ignore this entirely).\n\nI'm an atheist and I don't hide that. \n\nI've been a pallbearer three times at Catholic funerals, and most of the time that's been with other atheists, Protestants, and Jews as the other pallbearers. You don't need to accept Jesus as your personal savior to be a pallbearer, even in a Catholic mass. I never had to eat a cracker, drink any wine, and I don't now my head when others want to pray (I just sort of look around and give nods to anybody else doing the same). Somebody is making their own rules up as they go. \n\nIs it (1) you won't participate if you have to walk to the alter in the church, or (2) she won't let you participate as a pallbearer unless you are willing to participate in the full mass (crackers, wine, prayer, and what have you)? Because I can tell you this much-- the priest doesn't want you to eat the cracker if you don't want to eat it.\n\nIf it's the first one, don't worry about it. It's just another section of the floor as far as we're concerned. Alter? Who cares? It's sacred to them but means squat to us.\n\nI'm betting it's the second one, but here's my thing-- your brother is dead (sounds harsh but I shouldn't have to sugar coat that for someone that hasn't swallowed the Kool Aid). None of this effects him in any way. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned-- bury my body in Catholic dirt or Protestant dirt; burn my body and put it in a jar or scatter it off the side of a mountain; launch it into space or throw it in the ocean-- none of it matters. It's all sentimentalism, I'm already gone, and I didn't believe in the sacred anyways.\n\nPoint of reference: My mom says I should cremate her and, for all she cares, flush her down the toilet-- but not all at once, she insists, because that would cause a clog. \n\nThat is how an atheist should feel about the whole thing.\n\nI'm reading a lot in this thread about \"the person's wishes\" and \"honoring the memory.\" That's all sentimentalism. If you and your brother lived by reason, then you, like my mother, should have zero feeling on this. \n\nDead people don't have wishes. They are gone. This has zero affect on him or your memory of him. Whatever issues your mom is working through, whatever little charade she wants to put on, it can't touch him. The only person you have to worry about is you.\n\nAnd I'm not saying you have to respect her beliefs. They're nonsense, and there is no need to pretend they are anything but that.\n\nBut it comes down to how you want to react to her insanity. You can choose emotion or you can choose reason. If you think carrying a heavy box from one side of a room to another is some sacred duty you have-- then you do what she says. It isn't fair-- but atheists don't have to pretend the world is fair or that laws on who gets to determine these things are sane.  If you think your brother is better honored by way of you standing on principle-- do that. The harsh truth though is that it has zero bearing on him-- he literally could not care less (or at all).\n\nThere is no need to be angry with the situation-- his battles are over. Add \"burying atheists as if they were Catholics\" to the list of religious non-sense, and carry the true memory of him onwards.\n\n", "My father passed last a little over a week ago.\nI am an atheist.  My father drifted in and out of faiths (often due to mental issues).  At the end of his life, he was an atheist again.\n\nTwo days after his passing, there was a memorial service for him at my mother's Church of Christ.  When I found out it was happening, I was very upset; it had nothing to do with him, and was< I felt, a poor way to honor my dad.  Regardless, I attended that.\n\nThere was another service a week later, which I ran, and did not feature a god.\n\nThe handy thing about being an atheist is that death is final.  \nMy father will not care that a Church of Christ honored him and sang psalms for him.  It mattered for my mother, who is alive.  Sure I took issue with the guys who felt so grateful that my father was baptized before he died.  For my dad, it doesn't matter.  As such I did what I could to not take it personally.\n\nHe will also not care that I made a memorial about people's memories of him, though that better reflected who he was and what he believed.  It mattered for family and friends who attended, and it mattered for me.  For him, it does not matter.\n\nIf you have not done so, I suggest you plan to honor your brother in a way that feels more appropriate for him, and for you, in a way that brings you some small degree of comfort.\n\nThis church service is not the end of your brother's memory.  You can honor him and remember him as long as you live, and do him greater service in that.", "If your brother was against religion, and now he\u2019s dead, then he won\u2019t mind or complain, because he\u2019s dead.  You don\u2019t have to worry about disrespecting his memory because other people co-opting his funeral reinforces his beliefs that religious people are hypocritical.  In a way, this honors his memory, because it proves him right in a way.  It\u2019s like a giant metaphorical middle finger.\n\n... but that doesn\u2019t matter in the slightest, because they\u2019re only making his funeral religious in the first place because they\u2019re the ones left alive.  They have to grieve, and they have to do it in their own way.  \n\nThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t suppress your urges to get angry and start shit.  He was your brother.  That\u2019s important.  You have a right to experience your emotions and trying to \u201cbe strong\u201d for everyone else will only fuck with your own grieving process.  You don\u2019t owe that to anyone.  You don\u2019t have to set yourself on fire to keep others warm.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to intentionally start fights, but you can let everyone know, in a very factual matter, that you are angry and disappointed.  Focus on using \u201cI\u201d statements as much as you can when you talk about it.  Just stick to the facts, and when people fly off the handle, repeat those facts repeatedly.  There\u2019s no way to out argue or shame someone who just keeps saying \u201cThe sky is blue,\u201d over and over.  And anyone who tries will, at the end of the day, know the truth even if they try to deny it.\n\nI will tell you this, though: your brother was more than your memory of him.  He was a lot of things to a lot of people.  Others are going to have completely different perspectives on him, and lead completely different lives, and have completely different beliefs.  But they\u2019ll also need to grieve.  And them holding a religious ceremony is no better or worse than holding a non-religious one to your brother, because those were his beliefs, and I doubt he\u2019d mind them grieving over him, even if he did think they were misguided in the way they did it.\n\nBasically if they\u2019re disrespecting his memory, then that means they aren\u2019t disrespecting him, they\u2019re disrespecting you.  Because they\u2019re your memories.\n\nAnd you can decide to be magnanimous or ironically self-righteous.  If I were you I\u2019d choose magnanimity so my dead brother didn\u2019t ironically  also give me the metaphorical middle finger for acting like some zealot who let his personal fanaticism cause harm to others.  I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t like how religious fanatics do it, so if he wasn\u2019t religious, I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019d be disappointed to see his brother fall victim to an anti-religious form of the same underlying character flaw.\n\nBut hey, that\u2019s the best part, you know.  You can think whatever thoughts you want to about the whole thing.  You don\u2019t have to go with your first reaction, because you\u2019re not beholden to any kind of religious dogma.

Your mother has to go through what no parent should. What alternate arrangements do you want? Can the rest of the family not take your lead? If not, go through with it. Now is not the time for argument and more pain. Arrange your own non religious funeral for him for family who agree and friends.

But if I may recommend one thing, it's for you to see that there's no right or wrong response here. Everything has its reasons and its potential effects.\n\nWhat I'd recommend is that you take a step back and breathe. It sounds like your last hours, days, weeks, maybe months have been a nightmare. You're upset, exhausted, shocked, and still in every way morning your brother. It's okay to be miserable and angry.\n\nThe question is where you will go from here. Your brother, sadly he is gone. As you, like I do as well, probably don't believe in any kind of afterlife, do you think he cares in which place his loved ones say goodbye?

Do you think you might be able to talk to the priest about your brother's (lack of) faith and stress that you'd be very grateful if he could talk kindly and not overly focus on the religious element? Most Catholic priests tend to know how to deal with such a situation, unless you face a very radical/conservative one you'll probably be able to keep it to the minimum. On those occasions when I'm in a church I tend to try to listen to the talk from a kind of psychological or sociological perspective - \"why do they believe that?\" \"What message is this trying to get across - I might not agree with the words, but do I agree with the sentiment?\" Etc. Maybe this would help you.\n\nDoes your mother's belief bother you? You thought of her highly, but then she somehow reverted to *that*? While she might not share the same faith, do you think you still love each other in at least some ways? Do you really want to lose your mother as well in all this nightmare and drama?\n\nIf you choose  to go, what could you contribute to the ceremony? You love your brother, do you really want to get the facade of religion ruin your chance to say goodbye and maybe one last time tell everyone about him? If you do, do you think you can speak from a place of love and respect, rather than let your anger over this situation get in the way? Maybe you can tell, honestly and openly, that he would not have thought highly of the church he is in, but - probably - that he would be immensely happy about the people within, and all that those people meant to him?\n\nWhy do you think your mother really wanted to hold it in the church? To spite you and him? Or maybe rather because she herself is desperate and mourning and clinging to any kind of hope that her son is not lost forever?\n\nDespite all the conflicts of the past, would your brother have wanted you to clash and fight over this? Or to try to get through these hard days the most unscathed as possible?\n\nI know the past days were hard. You have so much you want to get rid of and change about how things have gone. But one or five or ten years from now, what would you most regret? What would you most want to have done? What would put you most at ease?\n\nI hope you find your solution. Its okay to be upset, angry and all other emotions at once. Please remember to breathe, look out of the window, think of your brother. Take a step back, out of your mind and into the future.

If it gives your parents some comfort, then maybe you gotta take one for the team this time. :/   It makes Christians very uncomfortable to think about a loved one potentially not being saved. It's not out of judgement, its out of love. I promise. So while you are grieving the loss of your brother, they are also grieving for their son and concerned about his eternal soul. I know you do not believe this, but since they believe it with all their hearts, it might be very horrifying to them to think that their son might not be saved. If a religious service makes them think that they are doing something for their son, please let them. ", "Attend for yourself. Honour the brother that you knew.

This is respectful of believers. It is also a stronger fight.\n\nThe Catholic Church has many rules and is a hierarchy. Contact your local bishop and let them know that your non-Catholic brother is going to receive a funeral mass against his wishes. [Canon Law (the rules of the church)](http://canonlawmadeeasy.com/2007/04/27/can-a-non-catholic-be-given-a-catholic-funeral/) has definite answers for just this scenario.\n\nYou can also insist that you pick the priest.

A huge element of Christianity is in the belief of an afterlife in Heaven, and your mom might just be trying to give your brother a chance to go to Heaven (still beliefs, no offense meant).

My father did not want to be buried by a church and truth be told no church would bury him as he was not an active member. But due to family pressure we had to get a priest to do the memorial. So we compromised and hired a hall and a priest to say a few words. \n\nIn my opinion a funeral is not really for the deceased but for the people they are leaving behind to help find closure. Traditional funerals are what are expected I suppose with the older generation. \n\nI hope your memory of your brother won't be tarnished by your Moms need to have a 'religious' funeral.

If you want to foot the cost of the funeral, then maybe you can have a say here. Look, I get the vehement hatred of a cruel god. That's your belief and you're entitled to it. But your mom gave birth to him and brought him into this world and wants to give him her kind of send-off. She already knows your feelings about this, but try to rise above this and be the better person. After all, you don't need religion to be that person, right? I'm sorry about your loss here.

She is being selfish, and although I understand that she is grieving, she has absolutely no right to control what happens to your brother, in life or death. Also, let her know that you will be making your own funeral arrangements so that she can't do anything like this to you, since you obviously can't trust her to respect your wishes.\n\nMaybe it seems harsh, but if you give religious people an inch they'll take a mile.

To me the funeral is just a ceremony and nothing more, the important part is that they dont falsify his memory or who he was. Had a relative that was moderately open about his Atheism despite his religious parents. Had passed unexpectedly. The parents had this speech at his ceremony about how he had accepted god about a month ago and was accepted into the kingdom ect. He had texted me the week before he passed and religon being a topic in the conversation, I can tell you he absolutely did not change his opinion at all nor did he alude to it in anyway.\nAs for your mother, ignore her, take this time to focus on yourself to heal, I know it sucks that she'll recieve this action as an act of faith or belief, but im sure itll make it all the more satisfying when you tell her where she can shove it next time she wants to broach the subject. \n\n", "Maybe donating to an atheist organization/cause in your brother's name would help somewhat?

I'll comment under the assumption that you're not prepared to spirit him away or take legal action to see him off in a way he would have wanted.\n\nIt may help to point out that I'm agnostic, a close cousin to atheism; I acknowledge the possibility of more to the world than we know, but I lack the arrogance to make assumptions and label them. A few years back I buried my father, and I wept as I prayed for him not because I believed it was being heard but because I'll be damned if I wasn't going to try *just in case*.\n\nBack to your predicament. I feel like I would be open about my feelings (no sense lying about it) but shift focus to remembering your brother in a good way. It should actually make shutting down arguments quite simple if you phrase it as such. I think I would go through with the Mass, for the sake of being there for your brother and  to avoid burning a bridge with your mother. Being the bigger person is a terrible burden, but it's worth it in the long run. They say that funerals are for the living, so try to keep that in mind. The Mass is for your mother, I imagine she's grief-stricken and not likely to be rational in any arguments that come up.\n\nGoing forward, then, maybe there's another way you can give your brother the send-off he deserves. It could be as simple as pouring one out in his favorite hiking spot or creating something to remember him by. I can't begin to guess what would be special to the both of you, but you can. Make something, even if it's only a fond memory that you know he would've approved of.", "I'm going to respond from a very practical perspective.\n\nIf your brother was under 18 years of age, then I suppose his mother, as his legal guardian, has the right to decide the matters of his funeral.\n\nIf your brother was 18 or older, then I suppose some kind of will or testament is legally binding and must be respected by others. If he has no will or testament, then I suppose his closest legal kin (his mom) would have the right to decide matters of his funeral.\n\nI'm 32 and I have a will (just a free one I made online) and there's a specific section about how my funeral is to be held, and that there are to be no religious ceremonies whatsoever.\n\nI'm sorry for what you've gone through. One thing to keep in mind is that your brother would likely want family harmony much more than a funeral that was of his liking, so do all you can to prevent this from becoming a war among yourselves and your relatives.

The reality is the funeral and related events are for the living.

I'm not Catholic so I don't know if this requirement for being a Pallbearer is the church's requirement or your mothers. I can think of a few options you could try to deal with this\n\n* Have a non-aggressive conversation with your mother. Ask her if she is really going to refuse your being a pallbearer at your brother's funeral. Explain to her how hurtful this would be to you. Tell her that if she EVER expects you to find religion (not that I am saying you would or should), having religion prevent you from honoring your brother at his funeral is guaranteed to make that never happen.\n* Threaten your mother with making a loud, painful and brutal scene at the funeral. Probably don't actually do it, but if you think the threat might work, try it. This should be a last resort for obvious reasons.\n* Speak to the Priest who will be overseeing the ceremony. I am an atheist who was raised Jewish, and I was the best man at my friend's wedding in a Catholic ceremony. The Priest sat down with me and discussed what parts of the ceremony I was comfortable taking part in so that there were no issues. Hopefully you will have a similarly understanding Priest.\n\nI hope this works out for, and again I am sorry for your loss.", "I am Roman Catholic, but I\u2019ve never been a fan of shoving it down the throats of those that don\u2019t care to hear about it. \n\nFrom your prospective, it sounds like your brother would have had an opinion on being buried in the Roman Catholic tradition. As such, you should definitely consider making a case for him being buried in a far more secular manner.\n\nSometimes, I would mention the option of keeping one\u2019s thoughts to themselves in situations where it may bring merit, but it sounds like you cared about your brother more than anything else. If this is something you\u2019re willing to stand your ground on, I would advise that you do so.\n\nTo keep quiet may only cause you to resent your mother for a long time. At least vocalize your thoughts to someone. At least make it clear that you disagree. Silence is considered acceptance by others, so don\u2019t go along silently right now.", "There might be more going on here. I can\u2019t imagine what you\u2019re going through. As an anti theist, I strongly relate to your brother, in that respect. The detriment caused by religion\u2019s attack on cognitive development is unjust and causes a lot of pain. If I were your brother, I would want my death to cause the least amount of pain in a already painful world. So, what you do from here should be about you. What would make this go smoother for you? Do you need to be the pall bearer? If so, will contesting this be more or less stressful? Ultimately, we all have to cope. Find whatever you\u2019re willing to tolerate and what you won\u2019t.

You would do well to support and comfort her in this time.\n\nI will point you to a story that I think your brother would have appreciated.\n\nDiogenes was a philosopher in Ancient Greece. When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, \"Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!\" When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied \"If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?\" At the end, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the \"proper\" treatment of the dead.\n\nI am very sorry for your loss. I know very well that this is a trying time for your family. My advice is to grieve for your brother, and remember the good times you had, but also take time to support your loved ones that are still here on Earth.", "I haven't read all of the comments, but one thing I have to ask is has your brother ever expressed his wishes about a burial? Has this been detailed in a will? If so, your mom has to respect his final wishes. \n\nAs a practicing Catholic, I wouldn't want my family carrying out my burial contrary to what I believed. Your mother shouldn't be doing this because for one, during his decline if he had been practicing he would've asked for last rites. Sounds like he didn't.", "This is tough.  I agree with the other comments that you should make your mom's comfort/grieving a priority, but here is what you both should consider when choosing a burial site:\n\n\\- Is the place easily accessible?  If you're going to have to drive an hour to the other side of town, it's probably not worth it.  You want to make it easy to visit, and easy for other people to visit.\n\n\\- Do they maintain the gave site/in perpetuity? (they should) but for how long? 50 years? Hundreds? Until the organization shuts down?\n\n\\- What are your customization options?  Can you have a vase with flowers, can you erect customized tombstones, etc?  Some places are very limited.\n\n\\- Where is the rest of your family being buried?  Maybe your mom could buy a plot for herself now next to your brother's so she can be with family when she passes.\n\n\\- How expensive will it be?  Will they let you hold a wake/the services you want to hold, or will you  have to pay someone else?\n\n\\- Grieving is a strange process, and people get really hung up on details like this.  I think the most important thing to consider is the ease of access of the place and to make sure it's somewhere you're comfortable visiting to grieve.  If you're truly going to feel super uncomfortable in a church, maybe tell your mom that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm so sorry you're going through this.

Let me share a personal anecdote about this.\n\nMy mom has 12 siblings. Almost 6 years ago, one of her brothers died. He was the first of her siblings to die. He had moved across the country years before his death. He had been diagnosed with cancer and fought the good fight for two years. My mom and her siblings all attended catholic school for many years and were raised in a catholic home, but I would describe my aunts and uncles as more spiritual than religious. I\u2019m aware that their catholic upbringing made a mark on them, but they were not over the top in any way. \n\nLeading up to his death, my mom spent a lot of time talking on the phone with her brother. He knew the end was near. \n\nAfter his death, some of my aunts and uncles arranged a memorial service for him in a church in our home state. A funeral was held for him where he had been living with his wife and children, but the memorial was for family and friends here. His wife and children flew in and attended this with our family. \n\nMy mom didn\u2019t go. She thought that he would have found the idea of a religious memorial ridiculous. He would have much rather we had a BBQ at his mom\u2019s house. \n\nShe hasn\u2019t talked to more than half of her siblings or her mother since then. She didn\u2019t go to her father\u2019s funeral or her mother\u2019s funeral. \n\nI\u2019m sure there were other issues involved as well, but the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back was the fact that my uncle wasn\u2019t religious and she didn\u2019t find a religious service appropriate. \n\nBut you know what it did? It gave closure to his other siblings and his parents. It gave us a chance to be together to celebrate him.\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way. If you\u2019d like to pay tribute to your brother another way, I urge you to organize that. But please, don\u2019t let this break your relationship with your family. I am constantly hurt and confused by the fact that my mother can be so cold to her own siblings. My sister and I have made a pact to attend one another\u2019s funerals (even if one of us is already dead lol). \n\nIt hurts. My family is broken for such a stupid reason.\n\nOh, and by the way, I also identify as atheist. But I\u2019ll be damned if I\u2019m not in the room to laugh and cry with my family while we share memories of the ones we love who have departed.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss, OP.

This cloth is required from a time when people bought ostentatious caskets to show off, and it is supposed to represent the equality of all, poor or rich, in the eyes of god. The only point of a pallbearer is to carry the casket to and from the alter, although most wheel it these days. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do that, consider carrying the casket at the cemetery from the hearse to the graveside; this isn\u2019t a \u201cpallbearer\u201d but is still carrying your brother one last time.

ESPECIALLY, because so many of my wishes have nothing to do with religious rites, but treatment of my physical self after death. I have given instructions on how to handle my body and any viable organs after death. These instructions are not conventional. No preservatives, no makeup, all viable organs donated, no expensive/metal coffins. Basically buried in a shroud or a wooden coffin, no religious rites only stories told by friends, and all the money saved on the bullshit to be used to put me in a place with trees and I want my wake/viewing/funeral all in one in the woods. So I can give back to the earth the only thing I have worth giving to her. Also, I have written down three songs that MUST be played while I\u2019m laid to rest. They may change if I continue to live longer. But if my family pumped my dead body full of chemicals and buried me in a steel coffin, I would be devastated. Because they felt the need to strip me of my very last, final decision, and refused to allow me to give my final repayment to the earth that has housed me, fed me, and sheltered me all these years. They would essentially be stripping me of the ability to complete my life here on earth as I\u2019d lived it. To knowingly disrespect a persons final wishes is one of the greatest wrongs that can be done to them, because people live on in memory. If my family arranged a funeral that went against my wishes, I hope someone would stand up for me. \n\nAll of my closest circorthosele has been informed of how I want my death rites to go, and if I were able to see them disrespect those wishes, I would be absolutely fucking livid- might even try to angry haunt if that turns out to be an option. \n\nBeing dead is literally the most vulnerable your body will ever be. There is no one in there to stand up for the little meat suit you\u2019ve been wearing for your entire earthly experience. And although it\u2019s just a body, it\u2019s important. It represents your essence, your life\u2019s experience, it\u2019s the face of every interaction you\u2019ve ever had, and the entirety of your time spent on earth. Yet, your only advocates are your lawyer-designed-iron-clad-will and/or those close to you. \n\nAs someone who does not respect organized religion, I would not want any of my services to beheld in a church. I would be extremely angry and disappointed if they were. I would also stand up for any of my friends that I knew would not appreciate it while living. Even though someone is dead, it does not mean that their personhood and beliefs should be railroaded by family. If they are, then that means their family really weren\u2019t that close to them and don\u2019t need the rites of their preference as they never truly loved the person, just the idea of them. ", "Listen dude, your brother has moved on from this world. He is no longer here physically. He no longer has to worry about our human attachments and emotions. He doesn't care what's happening to his body or this stupid fight your having in your head about honoring his memory by refusing to partake in religious ceremony. This ceremony is for the living, if this is what your mom needs for her own comfort and piece of mind, who cares. Let her have it. You don't have to believe in it or agree with it. What does it really matter to you, besides this 'principle' of anti religion you want to stand up for in honor of him. He doesn't care, that's the perk of being dead, you don't have to worry about this bullshit anymore. Drop it. Go to the church, suck it up, stop being selfish, and let your mom get her comfort, even if it is based on something you don't believe. ", "for you OP... \n\nI dont like organized religion at all. But religions do have some awesome ideas. \n\nOne thing I've been told about Catholicism is that theres a cloth that the priest uses for the chalice when they are performing the sacrament of the Eucharist. \n\nThis cloth is a relic of a martyr. When a bishop comes to visit a church the first thing they do is go and check on that cloth. \n\nThe cloth is a relic of transcendence. A person transcending themselves for their beliefs... dying for what they believe in. That's profound to me when you take away all the crazy shit with religion. \n\nI ask myself: would I die for my beliefs now? would I let someone else die for my beliefs? what would ever make me believe in something so much as to make me die for my beliefs? \n\nThe only answer I can give myself for the last question is that I know I would die for love. I would transcend myself for love through love. \n\nThere is so much to hate about religion...  but there is intrinsic value to take from. I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my brother when I was 17 and we were always together. I hope the best for you. \n\n", "I'm sorry for your loss, and understand your frustration. I'm an atheist that has been to many funerals. My $.02:\n\nFunerals and services are for the living, not the dead; your brother doesn't care now one way or the other. No offense.\n\nIt's just a ceremony and probably not worth starting a family feud over, so I agree with your approach. And, in the big scheme of things, Catholic service is at least *predictable* (sit, stand, kneel, eat, kneel, sing...) with minimal commentary. I recommend \"taking communion\" - you can claim ignorance \"everyone was walking up\" and some folks who had to do classes and study first will be offended. Plus, after 35 minutes, a snack is nice. \n\nHowever, you are likely going to need to defend your views from the evangelical (Catholics? Weird. I thought people only converted from Catholicism, not to it) at some point. Be calm. Choose your arguments in advance if you're going to engage. Don't let them upset you. Smile when you can. \n\nYou can stand firmly by \"<my brother> wouldn't have wanted any of this\" and still participate. Don't let them exclude you. \n\nAlso, i can think of many protest sort of responses if you're interested e.g. clothing - you could wear something that shows your views or put it in/on his casket. Mentioning pedophile priests is always fun - \"do you think the pope is in on it?\" \n\nLastly, money. Funeral stuff is *really* expensive. Even if there's an insurance policy, it's likely the beneficiary is paying for services. Like a wedding, someone is paying the bill for everything and understandably has some say in how it goes.\n\nI wish you the best. DM me freely.", "Personally I would not allow your mother to do that as if it\u2019s something he despised it would be incredibly disrespectful to do that exact thing in his death.

And remind her ASAP that she's disrespecting his wishes and that you won't be willing to forgive or forget that if she doesn't change course.

", "First off, I am so sorry for your brother's loss, while I do not know your exact pain, I know how bad this can hurt.  When we lose someone close to us, it is very easy to feel alone in your pain, and it feels even worse when you feel that things are taken out of your control.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, you have to remember that your mother is feeling this pain too.

This ceremony will give your mother some peace for his passing, she has already grabbed that relief for herself. What you can do, is make sure you remember your brother each and every day as you feel he would have wanted you to. Remember the good times you had, remember the arguments, remember those crazy nights, and remember the calm times. Most importantly, tell his stories, to old friends, new friends, strangers, and future children. That is how you will truly honor him. Be strong, and feel free to reach out if you need too.

For your peace of mind, create a funeral directive. I don't know how old your brother was, but if he was an adult, he had the ability to have a say in how he was going to be remembered. Regretfully he now has no such voice other than you. \n\nCreate a directive for yourself, so someone else isn't going to have to go through what you are. \nTake solace in knowing that, although he may have hated the way he is going to be last remembered, the process is still something that will help others deal with the emotions.\nSay your goodbyes however you need to. In that moment it is your time to absorb the finality of it all. And if others don't approve, fuck em.

It is clear that you love your brother and only want to express the wishes he would have had. I would say to keep an open mind about it though.

I hope you can take care of yourself and get support in the coming months and year to help you handle the grief you are experiencing. \n\nMy take on your situation is this: Your mother is most likely as deeply affected by your brother's death as you are, and the difference in religious views that makes this so hard is unfortunate, unexpected, and a tough judgement call. She probably is fearful that if your brother is not buried according to the Catholic faith, he might end up in purgatory or hell. I don't believe this, and you probably don't either, but it may torment her for the rest of her life if he is not buried this way.\n\nI realize that you feel tormented, too. My suggestion is to talk to the priest, and hopefully the priest is a decent person who can come up with a compromise that works for both you and your mother.\n\nI completely understand you and your brother's disdain for organized religion.

Your grief matters too FFS.", "There are a few things here.\n\nFirst, if your mother has his estate (control over who has his debts/equity), there is not much you can do. This should be in an advance directive or a will. Your priority should be to check that.\n\nSecond, if your brother wasn't confirmed, most Catholic churches won't hold the funeral. For the unlikely chance they do hold it, I would inform the priest of your brother's views. Priests tend to be fairly level headed and understanding. This is your best course of action.\n\nFinally, if you need advice, contact the funeral home. The director should be able to help you out and they usually have a legal expert on staff/payroll that can go through wills/advance directives. If not, the county coroner/health department would be the next POC.\n\nIt is rough hearing about this. I used to work at a funeral home and this is really common. We usually had this about once every two months. I hope this helps out. Good luck.", "Personally I think you should  be a pallbearer regardless of the way hes being barried, at least I would for my brothers I guess is what I'm saying. On a side note Roman Catholics are very \"religious\" and may not even do a burial on somebody that was a known atheist. Depends on the priest and how radical they are. Just some food for thought.\n\nAlso, I'm a non denominational Christian and find that your brothers disagreements with \"religions\" is just that. He disagrees with religions, traditions that preach hate and exclusion. In my beliefs, maybe I'm radical, but a lot of things you listed are simply so wrong and painful to read knowing full well that this is the picture that so many people have painted of Christianty by their actions. The Catholic church being one of the greatest offenders. I'm sorry that the people you and your brother have encountered have been the type to preach love and acceptance but put you down for disagreement or questioning.

But you are also in a bad place so here is a different perspective: Don\u2019t do anything and go along with it. Here is why:\n\n- Atheism is not a religion, it is the opinion that religious believes are unfounded. Therefore you and your brother know that it really makes no difference how one is put to rest. You have grown past superstition and living in accordance with vage principles. Well, then who gives a fuck if there is a service. \u201eAs long as there is good food, who cares.\u201c - Atheist\n\n- You have experienced tremendous loss. But so has your mom. She is looking for a way to cope. You feel her way is misguided and I agree. But your brother will not suffer more from this. Neither will you if you put it down. But if it is not done her way your mother will suffer. In the end the choice now is create more suffering or let it be. What would your brother want, taking this into account?\n\n- You know more than anyone here that life is short. You have just learned that the hardest way. Now how do you want to spent you time? Fighting your mother, who cannot be reasoned with because she is hurting so much (and/or because of being stuck with beliefs)? Honor your brothers memory by not wasting time - that is the greatest respect you can pay. We have established: Religious mumbojumbo is non-sense. That is fine. But accepting that opposition is not helping at this time and keeping family peace by putting your anger down - that is a honoring the short lives we have.\n\n- Allow the possibility that all of this is pissing you off most, because anger is easier to feel than pain. It may seem that there is an opportunity to defend your brother an you want to focus on that. But he is gone and that is the hardest part. I feel you man, I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nConclusion: \n\nA heartless man would not care and just go along with it. A passionate man would cause a scene and oppose his mother. A wise man would stick to what he knows is true, but go along with it, accepting that the situation calls for peace and healing, not anger and more suffering. \n\nI don\u2019t know you, but maybe this helps.", "Did he write a last will and testsment, any sort of last wishes, idk if they're legally binding but surely they're morally binding in some way", "I'm also pretty anti religion, would be a cold day in Hawaii before I consented to a religious funeral for myself, but my dad is fairly religious and I know that if arrangements were left to him then it would bring him peace to do it his way. Whether that be to honor my beliefs or not is ultimately up to him but to me it's all a bunch of mumbo jumbo anyway and what matters to me is his peace.  You may be his brother but she's his mother and I'm sorry but that trumps it.  You can express your thoughts to your mother but in the end if you're an atheist then you know it's all mumbo jumbo anyway.  Funerals are for the living, not the dead, it's to bring them peace in whatever way that is needed.", "I'm sorry to hear he passed, but I'm glad he didn't suffer long in the state your wrote about previously.\n\nAs for the funeral... it's a really awful situation, and I am so sorry you're dealing with that at such a hard time.\n\nThe funeral your mother wants is more about your mother and what comforts her, not about your brother. She is doing what she thinks is right and best for her son. She is doing what she thinks is the right decision, likely because she can't see how it wouldn't be right. She is blinded by her faith. You won't be able to convince her that it's not the right choice because she refuses to see  the truth or believe it.\n\nBut, that said, it will be a comfort to her, and others.\n\nThat aside, why are they deciding what happens? Did your brother never write down or explain what he wanted for his funeral arrangements? Did he never tell anyone? Social media? Anything? \n\nIf not, I'm not sure theres much you can do to stop what they're doing. If the religious funeral happens, I would recommend doing your best not to create a scene. That would harm others in their own grieving. If you did, you'd be no better than they are being right now.\n\nWhether you go to her funeral for him or not, you may want to organize your own memorial service for him. \n\nYou said before, when he wasnt waking and showed no brain activity, that he was already gone. The body isn't him. Yes a religious funeral is an insult to his memory, but that's her problem. That's her insult. Do what you can to respect his memory in whatever way you can.

Since he didn't, would it have mattered to him? Would he want to \"shout out\" and disrupt a religious service being held for you if it was you who was being remembered?\n\nSeems to me your \"hate\" of religion is a \"religion\" in and of itself given how vehement you are about the service. Being an atheist and hating religion are two separate things of course. I am a Christian and I often times hate religion. But what is it you are trying to accomplish here? Because this really isn't about your brother anymore, right? He's gone. To an atheists way of thinking, he simply no longer exists except in the memories of others. So, this is now about you and your mom. It's about your relationship with her.\n\nIf you know in your heart he would have hated being paraded around in a Christian ceremony and you feel strongly enough about it and want to make a statement calling out all of those idiotic Christians, then I say go for it. You only live once. Just know you will be making it about you. Just as your mother is making it about her by insisting on the Mass. Your bother doesn't care anymore.", "Maybe I'm not one to be interjecting my opinion on what would probably not have been your brother's feelings but...well...he's gone and I dont think a ceremony after his death is going to change who he was in life, it won't define him.

They also know id expect them to make damn sure that whoever is at my service knows that I'd be pissed. So with that being said, I'm not saying you should take such drastic measures. But if you exhaust all reasonable options, build up the courage to give him the proper send off you feel he would've really wanted; regardless of what your mother or family thinks. Whether it be a eulogy for the ages, or just straight up trashing everything about the service in his honor ( whatever your flavor might be ) At the end of the day you're all there for him and each other. It's the last time anyone will ever see him, or even potentially all be together again for quite some time. People will always have their own perspectives, but it sounds like you shared a very close and intense bond with your brother. Which means you probably knew him better than almost anybody else.

We may evangelize, we may offer aid in His name, but we must not force anyone to believe.\n\nThe priest (being one instructed in the catechism of the Church) should understand that. He might still proceed with the ceremony (as believers do have the right to mourn as they see fit), but he may be able to get your mother to calm down.

Hugs from my family to yours.", "First I'm so sorry for your loss and I am appalled that your mother would try to force your brother's funeral to be something he never would have wanted. Now I have heard before that funerals are for the living, but while I agree with that partly, the person's wishes should be respected. As a christian I believe everyone has the rights to their own belief and to make their own choices for their lives. I might not agree with everyones choices, but I accept that everyone has their rights. Your mother should not force her faith on your brother for his funeral, because it's not what he would've wanted. I can't speak for other religions, so I won't, but it sounds like you don't really understand christianity and that you've had experiences with people who claim to be christian but aren't really because of their intolerance and hypocrisy, which is sad because these kind of people give christianity as a whole a bad name, and they don't understand what it's all about. Forcing a Roman Catholic funeral is intolerant and disrespectful, and while I'm a christian I believe that everyone needs to be more tolerant of everyone's beliefs instead of forcing their own on other people because that only causes division among people. I am not Catholic so I don't know much about the difference between them and other types of Christianity, but I'm pretty sure they can't do full Catholic rites if he wasn't catholic and I would mention this to your mother. I disagree with you on a religious standpoint, but I wish you luck in convincing your mother to do what your brother would have wanted and not involve religion in his funeral. I hope this was respectful and I pray that you find peace with yourself and your mother during this time", "This was an upsetting read. My Brother is also anti-religious and It can prove frustrating sometimes. But his beliefs are as relevant as mine and should be respected as such. \nHOWEVER\nIf there is one sentiment regarding death that seems to be true its that the funerals and wakes and anything relating to those arrangements are more for the ones left behind rather than the one who actually died. Just playing Devil's Advocate here, maybe the only way your mom is capable of dealing with the death of her son is by turning to God, the idea of God, or a religion. Its very common for those in your mom's situation to do exactly that. She might believe that her connection to God will be enough to see your Brother again and it brings her peace. And there isnt (usually) anything too harmful about that. Unfortunately this can mean that she allows those feelings to manifest via controp of funeral arrangements being made even to the detriment of your Brothers own beliefs. This, im sure, would be very difficult for you to see happen. I think you're now in a position where your choices are limited. Unless your brother put you in the position as POA then it meant he knew it would default to your mom. Maybe he knew how it woukd play out and thought it would be ok. Either way, i would suggest that if you want to be a part of the funeral then you'll have to comply. Maybe after the ceromy you can have your own funeral. One that you beliwvw would be more in line with what you belueve he would want. ", "Go for a speach about life. He would love it. Don't mention God at all.", "First of all, thank you for sharing, OP. I'm sorry for your loss. As a born-again, Bible believing, fundamentalist Christian, I'd like to say that I am glad for your views on religion and that you realize how utterly worthless religion is. All religion is this way because it is simply the misguided attempt of sinful, fallen people to fulfill, on their own terms, their created need to worship their Creator. What is necessary is having an actual relationship with your Creator, and worshipping Him in spirit and truth. The Bible says these are the kind of worshipers God desires. John 4:24", "Based on the explanation you gave you and your little brothers problems with religion are based on a shallow understanding of it and look a lot more like the confirmation bias arguments given by most uneducated atheists. Since your mom raised you as a lapsed catholic you were most likely not given any true formation in your faith and blindly accepted whateverlies you were told about Catholic theology by your public school teachers and protestant(heretical) peers. You don't have the historical, education to discuss religion in any regard nor the philosophical let alone the theological tools necessary to understand any discussion you were to have, remember that God loves you and your little brother and forgives your sins, he died for them. I HOpe you can see past your own pride and try to understand what you have to be grateful for and to appreciate the miraculous creation around you.", "As someone who comes from an Uber religious family and is also an atheist I am torn. Most parents grasp onto religion as a safety cushion when something they cannot process happens, and that seems to be the case here- your mother was a zealot for trying to offer him the only safety she knew before he passed. \n\nThat being said, I would be absolutely outraged if I were in your shoes, which makes this hard as it will be one final \u201cmemory\u201d of your brother. You are being forced to participate in pageantry that you do not believe in or affirm in order to be able to pay final respects to your brother. \n\nI would talk to the priest, and perhaps the church janitor. Ask them if there is a place where you can silently slip out if you need to during the ceremony in case you need to collect yourself. If so, latch onto that. Cary him to the altar to appease your mother, stay for a few moments and then duck out. You can have this time to yourself to remember him outside of whatever religious message they decide to use to comfort your family. You can even sit and think of how much he would hate this if this situation were happening for another family member. Come back shortly before the service is over and finish your duties. \n\nThis way you present as if you support what\u2019s going on, do not upset any family members, and have time to yourself to remember him and think about how much he hated this type of shit. If anyone says anything you straight up tell them you couldn\u2019t handle sitting there and saying goodbye and needed a moment in private. That\u2019s all the explanation they need, and if they want to argue with that they can fuck off. ", "Funerals are for the people still alive, not the person who died.  This funeral is for your mother, to help her come to terms with your brother's death.  That doesn't mean it has to be \\*\\*your\\*\\* funeral.  You can have a separate time/ceremony/funeral for him.  You don't really need to body.  You just need to celebrate his life.  \n\nI lost my son several years ago, so I have an inkling of where your mother is mentally.  She's not thinking straight, she's not going to be logical, and she's having a difficult time coping with outliving a child.  That's not an excuse for the Catholic funeral, I'm just trying to let you know where she's at right now.  I think that going along with the entire funeral and possibly having your own, private funeral gives you the best chance for a future relationship with your mother.  And peace for yourself.", "I'm an atheist and agree with your brothers line of thinking.  If that was my funeral going awry, I'd want my brother to speak at the funeral and explain that I was an atheist and very much despised what is happening for *my* funeral. \n\nLots of comments say funerals are for the living and he's dead so he doesn't care. Bullshit. You live only once, you die only once. I would have wanted the people to know what I stood for despite their discomfort, and that I was willing to do so until the very end. ", "This isn't only about you, sorry to say.\n\nHate only generates more hate, I know it's a hard moment but use it to grow as an individual. If you hate religions for hating then aren't you doing pretty much the same?", "I\u2019m an atheist from a family of atheists. I\u2019ve had to deal with death very intimately over the last few years. My advice is this: for one, try to put your own feelings aside. Your family has been hit with a severe trauma. Everyone, including your parents, is trying to find some way forward, some meaning for life as it now stands, without your brother (their son). Try to view the service in the church as a ritual your parents are hoping will bring them some peace. Be there for them as their son, as your brother\u2019s brother, as a member of the family. Your brother is gone. He might not be thrilled about the service if he were here, but he\u2019s not. He would certainly want his family to find some peace. So try to help your parents find that, even if it means putting your feelings on the back burner.\n\nThat being said, I\u2019d encourage you to do something on your own that would be more fitting with what you believe your brother would have wanted. Maybe plan another memorial service. I don\u2019t know your brother\u2019s specific philosophy on death, but most atheists I know don\u2019t care too much about what happens to their body afterwards\u2014though some want it returned to earth or donated to science, it\u2019s not the body buried in a grave that concerns them. It\u2019s an assumption, but I\u2019d guess your brother would be concerned about those he loved being happy. So maybe hold a ceremony with close friends and family that you can design. I don\u2019t know how well, if at all, you can communicate your feelings to your parents. But maybe a simple, \u201cI know the service in the church was important to you, and that\u2019s why I wanted to be there to support you and the family. I\u2019d like to ask you to do the same for me, even if it isn\u2019t something you fully agree with. I need to do this for myself and to memorialize my brother and our relationship. It would mean a lot to me if you could be there to support me, too.\u201d You don\u2019t need to place any judgement on their ritual, just show that you supported them, and would like the same in return.\n\nI also want to say that my heart goes it to you and your parents. I won\u2019t claim to know what you\u2019re going through, but know that one more human on this planet is thinking about your family, and wishing you the best this life has. ", "Most of your assessments about catholicism are inaccurate. For example, one is not forgiven for simply saying sorry after committing murder etc... in fact most of the things you wrote are not accurate at all about religion. \n\nOn another note, one can still believe in god, love and have faith but disapprove of religion.", "He\u2019s dead and didn\u2019t believe in an afterlife so he will neither know, nor care. Funerals are for the living. You are angry and sad because you lost your beloved brother and best friend. By all means, voice your feelings and concerns to your family members in the spirit of transparency- but know this conflict is not about him- it\u2019s about loss. What is done with his body cannot change the fact that he is gone. Funerals are for the living. Your family should come together to plan something and each contribute a piece to the celebration and mourning. Sometimes this is not possible because emotions of grief are running too high. In such a situation, you probably will have to find ways to grieve privately in your own way. But remember he is no longer here to be offended by whatever happens. And the outrage you are imagining he might have felt about this funeral is just that- imagined. I can feel your sadness and frustration and despair in your writing, and I am so, so sorry. Sit with it and allow yourself to be still- and let the memory of your brother come to you. That is his afterlife. Hold him there. And move through this moment of tension with your family in peace. You are all grieving. ", "When our convictions collide with reality, there is inevitably a mess to sort through. In this case, it is the normal human reaction of emotionally attaching to information, and how this relates to our own sense of identity - and also our sense of the identity of the people we are attached to.\n\nThis, in a nutshell, is the root of your discomfort with this situation.\n\nNot your mom.\n\nNot your brother.\n\nAnd not your or his atheism.\n\nBut rather your emotional attachment to these people and ideas, which correspond to your values. Your sense of what is right, and what is wrong.\n\nAs an atheist then, perhaps a practical approach to this situation will be welcome?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis will be a bit clinical, but I'm hoping the attempt at rhetorical objectivity will help you to orient yourselves around ultimately what is most important in this situation - making sure that you are aware of all of the relevant choices that are in front of you at this difficult time, so that you can choose the one that best fits your concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, let's look at the facts.\n\n1. Your brother is dead, so he no longer has feelings to be concerned with.\n2. Your mother is alive, and grieving the loss of a son, and her feelings matter.\n3. You are alive, and grieving the loss of a brother, and your feelings matter.\n4. Others attending the funeral are alive, and grieving the loss of your brother, and their feelings matter too.\n\nSo, we have 4 parties, 3 of which are alive and have feelings right now. The 4th does not have feelings right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFunerals, insomuch as they are about the dead, are really about the living coping with what death means in general, what it means to us as individuals, and not least of all what it means to us as individuals in regards to this specific death. So, they are at once personal, and collective. The emotional tension, the stress, the impact that death has on each of us... it is a pain.\n\nWhen people are in pain, they are not at their most compassionate. Biologically speaking, this makes sense. When we hurt, that is a sign that we must take care of ourselves, and that changes the way we orient to the world. This is not just true of humans, but of any sentient form of life. Pain triggers reactions of self-defense, which are all based in uncertainty. And what could possibly be more uncertain than the nature of death itself? Life is a continuing mystery, but death is final and ultimately even more mysterious, because it is the cessation of a concept that is already quite mysterious already. The mystery within the mystery that is death, well... small wonder that this uncertainty results in fight, flight, or freezing responses as we mourn and grieve. Curiosity can also come into play... but the more we learn about death... the less curious we become to experience it (generally speaking).\n\nThis means then, that you are not going to be at your most compassionate. That's ok. You are in pain, and it would be weird, abnormal, and unhealthy if you weren't concerned about your own pain. So, it speaks highly of you that you decided to check your own sense of indignation while within this painful circumstance by gaining an outside perspective. Understand that this is not a \"normal\" response, even if it is a healthy one. To have this response, you must be compassionate, and compassion scales with intelligence as well as being reinforced by your environment, and so all of those factors have conspired to make you better equipped than most to deal with this situation as healthily as you have. Take pride in that... but realize that also removes your reasons for faulting others for not handling this as well as you have. After all, having an above average reaction to pain does not mean that more normal reactions are less acceptable or reasonable. Being exceptional means that you must hold yourself to exceptional standards.\n\nSo, where does that leave us?\n\nIt adds another set of facts to the list.\n\n1. Your brother is dead, so he no longer has feelings to be concerned with.\n2. Your mother is alive, and grieving the loss of a son, and her feelings matter.\n3. You are alive, and grieving the loss of a brother, and your feelings matter.\n4. Others attending the funeral are alive, and grieving the loss of your brother, and their feelings matter too.\n5. People in pain behave selfishly, and this is normal, understandable, and predictable.\n6. You are exceptional in your display of compassion and so must accept that you must hold yourself to exceptional rather than normal standards regarding your response to this situation.\n7. Funerals are for the living to mourn the dead, and to achieve some measure of peace regarding their relationship to the idea of death as well as their own mortality.\n8. Uncertainty in any form of life results in either fear or curiosity, and insomuch that death is uncertain, responses to death will often cluster around expressions of fear or curiosity (fight, flight, freeze, investigate - so 75% chance the response will be grounded in fear).\n\nSo, now that list of relevant facts is a bit more robust, but we're still not done. These facts are only relevant if they allow you to guide an outcome that you can be content with. Acceptance of reality, while a simple idea, becomes incredibly complex because of our preferences. Our feelings often obscure what is with our personal sense of what SHOULD be. The conflict between what is and what should be is thus an internal battle with our hopes for the future and the very real obstacles that make that future less probable.", "Does it matter? As an atheist, you do not nor should not care what is done with your body after death. I understand his rampant hatred for religion but funerals are not for the dead, they are for the living.

Even if it\u2019s not true, wouldn\u2019t the thought of her being able to reconnect with her baby in heaven give her a semblance of peace and closure? At the end of the day, your brother does not have a say and frankly neither do you. I can not imagine being alive and witnessing loosing my child.

The rules miiiiight have changed lately because things are becoming more open, but iirc Non Catholics aren't even *allowed* to be given a catholic funeral. Like I'm sure they don't bother asking when the family comes looking for one. But if you make it known that he was a devout atheist and didn't have good sentiments towards the church then the priest may at least keep the ceremonies short. Though iirc they're not able to do a full mass at all for someone who wasn't willingly part of the church. It used to be a *huge* taboo, but now it's kinda just an insult to both the decreased and to the church to do that. \n\nReligiously speaking your mother might be doing it for her own peice of mind. She's probably desperate to see her child again and at this point her last hope is in heaven. A lot of older Catholics believe you can't get into heaven unless you I have a proper Christian burial..... but even that completely relies on willingness. Doesn't matter how catholic the funeral is if your brother doesn't accept God, even in Catholic belief. A lot of the younger generation don't even believe that \"proper\" funerals are that important, it's more if whether you were a good person and want to be there. If you have a decent relationship with your mother you might want to gently remind her of this so she doesn't feel so bad if the priest does end up rejecting or shortening the ceremony. \n\nSorry I'm rambling. The point being that if the priest is aware of your brother's atheism he might change the service, or reject it altogether both for your brother's sake and because of the rules of the church.

I'm definitely going to die before my parents, and they are great actors who would relish giving me a wonderful Jesus laden goodbye (for themselves to look good in front of their church friends, of course) so fuck that. \n\nFor some of us, our parents are the cause of distress and years of abuse and psychological damage. So I'd say in that case, please honor the dead. They're dead. They won't even get to enjoy the food and booze in their memory. You shouldn't get to choose their last locations for them.

How would your brother want his family to behave when all of them are in pain but him?\n\nMy sense is that your mother is looking to find some semblance of certainty, and religion is what is bringing her some measure of comfort at this time. She, emotionally, is taking care of herself.\n\nOf course, this does not have the same impact on you, because for you, as it was for your brother, religion is not associated with those feelings. But, if this were a wedding, I'm guessing your brother and you both would have attended, and found no end of amusement at the religious proceedings. Ritual is omnipresent, even without religion we have rituals around the cycles of life and death, because as humans we find comfort in routine. I think you might find more comfort in imagining that your brother is in attendance with you as this shit-show unfolds than you will find in fighting the vehicle your mom is using to bring herself comfort. I also believe, that through that lens, you will find more cause for amusement than contempt or anger.\n\nBecause, according to how you framed it, religion is mostly toxic and largely unimportant. It can be useful, in a very limited way, and that utility seems to be at play for your mother. But no one in attendance will be ignorant of who your brother actually is, and there is nothing your mother can do with this funeral to change who he was in life.\n\nSo, celebrate him. Remind people of who he was, and who he wanted to be, and how his memory will continue to live on in each of you. Demonstrate through actions how unnecessary religion is, at this time, by simply ignoring it the way you would ignore any meaningless interruption of what is ultimately most important. Being a good brother, and a good son, and an example of exceptional compassion in action.\n\nBecause, 10 years from now, or when your mother is on her deathbed... how do you want to remember this time? Who do you want to be at this time? Do you want to fight for your values with people who are so siloed in their own pain that they are irrational? Or do you want to let people find comfort where they can while you act as a living memorial for all that was good that you and your brother both believe in?\n\nUncertainty is uncomfortable, which is why learning is uncomfortable.\n\nBut certainty is a result of understanding, and while we may not like that which we are certain of, there's very little cause to hate or fear it.", "This is the mentality of a 13 year old ", "Two brief things.

I know that stabbing, wrenching, blood-curdling feeling in your gut when your sister is in danger. I know how hard it is, and I know what I'm asking is even harder, but if you can, put your anger in the backseat. Be polite and cordial with her abuser. Don't speak badly of him to her. It will make them both demonise you and push her further into his arms. I'm sure that this tension is consuming your family at the moment but try to have a normal relationship with your sister. Be the safe person she needs and *will* need when this all turns to custard.\n\nWhen I was younger, having someone point out to me that these relationships were a two-way street helped a lot. Rather than telling her that he's bad or making her feel stupid, ask her questions. What are his good qualities? What does she get from this relationship? Love? Respect? A shoulder to cry on? The answers will reveal the root cause and give you an idea of why this predator has chosen her. I also suggest you look outside of her and observe her surroundings - your parents don't seem particularly active in her life or well-being, for example. Or, ask her why she is interested in dating someone older? Is it because he is employed, has more experience, and has his life together?\n\nThink carefully about how you phrase your questions. You cannot tell her what to think, but you can inspire her to consider her relationship with a different perspective.\n\nFor example, how young would she date? 13? 12? 10? 8? What does she think would be difficult about this?\n\nYou could ask her why she thinks he's pursuing her, why she thinks he likes to date younger. Could it be that he dates younger because he wants his partners to be unemployed, with less experience, and no life plan? Don't tell her he doesn't care, but remind her that if he genuinely did care about her well-being, he would put aside his own feelings and do what is best for her, which he knows isn't a relationship. He is pursuing her\u00a0*because*\u00a0he doesn't prioritise her well-being.", "This is so messed up.

I do not care about karma. This situation has turned dark and I will be making a final update in a few hours before I delete this account.\n\nMy mom and dad divorced when I was 5 years old, and my mom has been completely out of the picture ever since. My dad starting dating my now stepmom when I was 9, they got married right after I turned 10, and she immediately moved in with us. Obviously, since I didn't even know my mom, I quickly grew attached to her and she took me right under her wing. My dad couldn't have married a better woman, and she treated him right. I don't think I've ever seen her yell or get angry a single time in the entire 9 years that I've known her. Her and I have a great mother-son relationship, and I often went to her for private advice on things before I even considered going to my dad. \n\nNow, in the last few months, my dad has been acting sort of distant from my step mom. I don't know if it's because of the pandemic, I'm honestly not sure. She asked me if I had noticed, and I told her I had.\n\nA week ago, dad got a new phone, and he always gives me his old phone when he decides to upgrade, and it's always a huge upgrade for me from my current phone. I always make sure to reset it to factory settings and this keeps the \"new phone\" excitement. Two days ago, I was testing out the camera when I noticed some pictures and videos on the phone that were stored on the Micro SD that was left in the phone. Apparently those stay even when you return to factory settings. One of the videos I found was a video of my dad masturbating. My step mom never goes on business trips or anything, so why he would take a video like this? I decided to confront him.\n\nWhen I did, he looked like he had seen a ghost. He said to delete the video immediately and to never speak of it again. I asked him why he would take a video like this, and he said it's none of my business, and he made me delete the video in front of him(I saved a copy on a flash drive prior), and he said if I ever spoke about to anyone, particularly my step mom, that he was kicking me out and cutting me off completely.\n\nThis infuriated me. He was obviously cheating on my step mom. My dad is at work (he works night shift), so I asked her if I could email her a video I had found and if she could watch it in private (I didn't want to be there when she watched it, and the video was on a flash drive on my laptop). She looked puzzled, but she said sure.\n\nAfterwards, she asked me where I got the video and I told her everything. She said she had never seen the video before, and that she had been suspicious of him having an affair and this confirmed it. She started packing her bags, and she told me she is leaving. My dad doesn't know about any of this yet, but he will be home in a few hours. She's going to confront him then and most likely leave afterwards for good. I'm worried that I made a huge mistake. My step mom is the the closest thing I have to a real mom, and she is leaving. I have no idea what's going to idea when he gets home. I'm lost.\n\nUpdate 1 and 2 are in the comments.\n\nUpdate 3: For those that didn't get the chance to see my first updates, my dad WAS having an affair. My step mom had her suspicions this entire time, and this confirmed it. And he admitted to having an affair during her confrontation when he arrived home from work. She left and he followed her separately. I still haven't heard from my step mom, and I'm currently staying at a friend's house. My dad doesn't know I'm here but I have dozens of missed calls from him. I have a lot of figuring out to do. I don't know if she went back home to get the rest of her things because I've been gone from home since the middle of the night last night. I would have updated sooner but I haven't been on reddit all day. \n\nI understand I was wrong for invading his privacy, but like I said, HE WAS CHEATING on my step mom and she has been nothing but perfect to him. I'll try to keep this post updated when I hear from my step mom so it can finally be closed. She hasn't answered any of my calls or texts and I still haven't spoken to my dad. I have no idea where she is but I still think it's too soon to call the police. She might just need her space. The last I saw her, she was pulling out of the driveway with my dad behind her.\n\nThis is my final update because this situation has taken a dark path. My step mom's family have not heard from her. Her friend Ruth hasn't heard from her. She didn't show up to work this morning and she wasn't there yesterday, either. The police have been notified.

She left and he followed her during their argument after he got home.

He spoke to someone on the phone earlier and said he was going to kill me when he found me.

If you're going to stir this much trouble in someone's life, especially if you (assumedly) depend on them and have to be near them, you need to establish a backup / safety plan beforehand. You state your father has a history of violence. Did you consider that before you made your step-mother aware of the video? At any point in time, did you wonder whether that violence would be directed towards your step-mother for leaving, or you for \"causing\" that to happen? You're young and maybe you acted in the moment - that's understandable. Next time, however, you really need to plan ahead for your own sake.

Your step dad could have just gotten a little freaky one night and decided to record himself jerking it for his own pleasure. Yea. Just because he is older and your dad doesn't mean he doesn't get horny and do weird things. You had no business telling your step mom about this, let alone sending her the video. You literally betrayed your dad by lying about deleting the video, promising you wouldn't say anything, and then telling your step mom about business that has nothing to do with you. He is your dad. Your relationship with him is different than the relationship he has with his spouse. You definitely crossed a boundary.

The last several relationships I have been in have never involved arguments, yet they ended because we were not right for each other.

It\u2019s not his fault his dad decided to cheat", "Do you make videos of yourself jacking off, only for yourself to watch and not send to anyone?

From this post we can\u2019t tell for certain that he was cheating (although I admit it\u2019s likely). The stepmother could be a sensitive and/or insecure person with a history of bad relationships who overreacted to the situation. The father could be turned on by videoing himself jacking off (probably not that uncommon) but ashamed that he took the video in the first place. Maybe he knew that the stepmom would react like this which is why he said not to show her. \u201cActing distant\u201d could mean anything. Honestly whether he was cheating doesn\u2019t matter now, so I think it\u2019s more useful to give advice on what OP should do rather than pass judgement on the father.\n\nEdit: I also think it\u2019s worth noting that the original post is inevitably not unbiased. We are being led to believe that the father cheated because that is what OP believes. We don\u2019t know the full story", "Retarded? Would you like to repeat that more loudly so all those with developmental disabilities & those who support them can hear? Moderators?\n\nAs well, OP's father *gifted* a phone containing pornography to his child. That gift then belonged to the recipient. There's zero obligation to correct the gift giver's error. There may have been alternatives to saving it & passing the actual vid onto their mum, but it was the father who seriously messed up, not his child. Major error on dad's part. *Zero invasion of privacy*. Dad gave his privacy away.\n\nDo you really think that if you hand over ownership of an old device somehow the buyer/recipient has no right to what you voluntarily handed over? If OP had been just months younger, they could have handed that phone & SD card to police & seen dad investigated for distributing to a minor. And save the histrionics about lying for somebody who wasn't facing a parent with a violent history & a mum they were concerned about, oh so pure you've-never-told-a-lie in your life troll. Lesson for you - b4 you sell your device - erase all your porn.", "Yes, it was a serious decision, but it's morally right. OP has done something incredibly selfless by giving their stepmom the evidence. \n\nAllowing her to stay in the marriage while being unknowingly cheated on would be incredibly selfish.

If you see this OP, get recording in some way, it might help you at some point in the future.

Maybe he\u2018s comfortable enough to post that kind of stuff online? Theres no indication that he\u2019s cheating yet almost every other comment just straight up agrees he\u2019s cheating.  I had to scroll through ~20 comment threads before i finally found one (this one) doubting his cheating, its like everyone just wants a witch hunt for cheaters...", "This is the most self-righteous comment I've ever seen. Good Lord, get over yourself. \n\nBut you brought up a great point - he handed over pornography to his 18 year old son. Pornography of him masturbating. That looks awful regardless of age. You think maybe that's why he's scared and upset and wants it deleted and not shown to anyone? Not that he's cheating?\n\nAlso, you said in your earlier post that he's a violent father... Where in the post does he come across violent and abusive? Legit asking. Did OP say somewhere else that he was? Or are you just making assumptions because he said he'd kick his 18 yo out?", "Yea looking at these comments, they clearly don't know the hidden parts of the story that the guys isn't telling us and are instantly saying that op Is a idiot and somethings wrong with him.", "I get what you\u2019re saying but not everyone can just financially support and house their exes kid. Especially while they are in the midst of completely shaking up their own living and financial situation at a moments notice. \n\nIt\u2019s not at all her responsibility and totally reasonable for her to not be able to take that on right now.", "This part! I wonder what the age range on reddit it because no one is even mentioning the fact that the kid was being creepy by saving his/her dads porn video, and furthermore, she overstepped her boundaries by dragging his/her step mom into something that he/she doesn\u2019t have concrete proof of.", "I know that we\u2019ve seen happy updates on reddit where step parents and cousins and siblings and friends\u2019 parents have saved people from their abusive parents. It would be great if the step mom was interested in having OP come along but we don\u2019t know if she\u2019s getting her own place or if she is financially reliant on OP\u2019s dad and is having to go stay in someone\u2019s extra room. We don\u2019t know if she has the ability to offer OP help or what mental/emotional state she may be in - if OP\u2019s dad is physically violent we can\u2019t assume that she\u2019s just leaving a marriage where things fell apart. She may also be afraid for her safety. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to raise the idea that he talk to her about leaving together and it\u2019s entirely different for the comments that are literally just \u201cMove in with your step mom!!\u201d OP is going to need a plan either way. \n\nIt\u2019s also telling that this woman who was apparently/allegedly cheated on and has a husband with a history of violence is packing and leaving while her husband is at work and he won\u2019t know until after she\u2019s gone.

Our friend's wife left him, told him he couldn't see his step-son anymore (whom he had been raising for 10 years), and he couldn't do anything about it because he was just the step-dad.  They've finally reconnected now that his step-son has a car and can see him without Mom knowing.\n Edit: Fine, since you apparently can't be bothered to read replies before you comment on this, I missed the part where OP is 18.", "How does this have so many upvotes and no one is mentioning that you literally have no idea if that's the case and that it's a massively hurtful and insensitive thing to say to someone in OPs position and with their background? They've been together since he was 10, this woman has watched him grow into a man and OP even says they have a very close relationship. What the hell is your basis for this?", "Where did i berate OP? Please put words in my mouth for me again, or better yet, tell me what you assume i meant, even if I didn't even say it. I literally just questioned the line of thought from the video to the deduction of cheating, so tell me, where did I berate OP?\n\nAlso, what in the WORLD is [this post you made? is this a troll account or something?](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9w68yu/i_need_advice_theres_a_really_pretty_girl_at_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "In another comment OP said the dad is also violent, add this to the kicking OP out threat during a pandemic.\n\nIf I find a video of my dad masturbating I wouldn't give a shit because his relationship with my mother is solely for religious reasons, they act nothing like a couple and they hate eachother so I couldn't care less if I find both of them cheating. This is clearly not the case for OPs parents, not all families are the same. \n\nThere might be a lot of things that we have no idea about, but we shouldn't always be pointing fingers at people who come here for advice and pretend we are all morally superior.", "I would engage in a conversation with them. I sure as hell wouldnt scold or threaten them for my mistake. Not saying it would be a proud moment or just ok, get the fuck out of here with that mentality.  But I would talk to my 18 year old kid and minimize the awkwardness.\n\n-The dad gave the phone to the kid.  Its on him for not wiping it/clearing the card.  \n\n-The kid asked the dad and was then yelled at, show he has far more maturity than the father.\n\n-If you dont want to get called out for something, you dont do it.  Period.  Once you commit the act you need to own it (you can try to run but it will catch up). \n\nIts not difficult.  The kid didnt go snooping.  The dad fucked up, then further fucked up by handling it so poorly.  Not sure why its so hard for you to acknowledge that.", "How did everybody just jump to the fact that he was cheating? Reddit has absolutely no right to even comment on this lol we know nothing.", "He acted strange because his son saw a video of him masturbating. Is it that difficult to understand. \n\nAnd it\u2019s ironic that you\u2019re saying don\u2019t be naive when making a blanket statement. No one makes a video of them masturbating without the intention of sending it to someone? No one? That\u2019s awfully naive on your part.\n\nAgain, there\u2019s zero indication of cheating and frankly I\u2019d question the maturity level and critical thinking skills of anyone who immediately jumped to that conclusion.", "This subreddit is called advice. You're not giving advice, you're shoving your judgement into a person's face, who is already in trouble. You, sir, are an asshole.", ">He said to delete the video immediately and to never speak of it again. I asked him why he would take a video like this, and he said it's none of my business, and he made me delete the video in front of him(I saved a copy on a flash drive prior), and he said if I ever spoke about to anyone, particularly my step mom, that he was kicking me out and cutting me off completely.\n\nMost people would say say we will talk about this later or something somewhere in that ballpark. Maybe apologize and ask them to not say anything to anyone. I'm to embarrassed to talk about this ever again. Just drop it and please don't tell anyone. Its not what it looks like.  Not threaten and tell them to never speak of it again. Then threaten extreme consequences if he ever says anything to any one especially the step mom. The reaction seems really extreme for embarrassment but it is still possible. \n\nKid really fucked himself though. I really hope he learns from this. \n\n\nEdit This is all probably made up for karma or whatever but he updated to confirm in his comments that his dad admitted he was cheating from them arguing.", "Sounds like you're an awesome, patient, mentally healthy individual. \n\nIt sounds like the dad isn't. My only point was it doesn't mean he is cheating on anyone.", "If anyone shares a private video of mine (no matter the context) after being explicitly told not to.  Consiquences are to be expected.\n\nI mean I don't know what level of entitlement you are permitting this 18 y\\o legal adult to have?", "and not everyone can get an apartment immediately, or a hotel room during covid", "You're responding to a comment that written two weeks ago. I didn't even know there was an update, so you can't use that as an argument. I do hope that she's okay. Can you link me to the update, please?\n\nAlso, if under 24 hours you can leave a person that has loved you for over 9 years to an abusive father despite this child being your stepson, than yes. You are an asshole.\n\nSource? Easy. My father (accused by my mother of being my father and not paying child support) decided to do the most responsible thing and take me in. When we did the DNA test, lo and behold! He's not my biological dad. I had already confessed to him the physical and sexual abuse I endured as a child under my stepfather and mother's roof and about three months later we did the test. Do you think he just sent me back? Nah, dude was chill as fuck about it. Told me I could stay with him and to this fucking day, I call him pop. That is called being a parent.\n\nThis woman cold blooded abandoned the child, plain and simple.", "I've been cheated on and I agree with them. Also, where are people getting this \"history of violence\" thing for the dad? Is it in some comment thread? Or do I just keep skipping over it in the original post? Cause I don't see anything about a history of violence, just that he's gonna kick him out.\n\nAlso, some people have weird kinks. Nobody knows why he had a video of himself masturbating on an old phone. Maybe he was cheating, maybe he wanted to watch it, maybe he had a side gig on the ole Phub making videos of himself jerking it? Who fuckin' knows? He didn't want it shared with anyone because his *son* had a video of him *stroking his dick* and that seems unbearably embarrassing. And maybe he doesn't wanna explain that shit to people. Maybe he figured his wife wouldn't understand and would leave - which is happening apparently. \n\nThe kid acted rashly. Maybe he's right, and his parents need to sort their shit out. But based off of what he *knew* he jumped to a *lot* of conclusions and made some serious choices with severe consequences because of that.", "And we will keep pointing it out until you edit it into the post we are commenting on.", "I found it in his recent comment history. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/i29yx5/i_sent_my_step_mom_a_video_of_my_dad_masturbating/g067utz?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\n\nAfter rethinking about it. You are absolutely right. Just the video alone doesn't automatically mean cheating. Some parent's getting confronted by their child like that will definitely get pissed off and angry about it as an immediate reaction. The accusation and disrespect would be enough.  Was thinking about it from my perspective not anyone else's."]}, {"title": "Opening a boba shop in 6 days...super nervous.
