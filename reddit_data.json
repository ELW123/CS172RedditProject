Since the initial idea 2 years ago, the app has expanded a ton and now includes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tracking all monthly/annual/one-off credits that banks add to a lot of their cards and expect users to forget about.\n* Amex, Bank of America, Chase, and Citi offers are integrated throughout the app to help find great new offers, keep track of how much you've used, and be reminded before they expire.\n* Database of over 3,000 credit cards to help you find the best sign up offers, points multipliers, and lots of other criteria.\n* There is a free version which lets you add all of your cards (no banking credentials at all, just the names of the cards) and it will sort all of your cards by category and help you check off all of the credits, as well as a Pro tier for more advanced tracking, custom/targeted offers, additional customization and notification options, and more. And if you're looking for another way to use the PayPal credit on your Platinum card, I even have a [special landing page](https://getcardpointers.com/paypal) where you can use the credit to upgrade to Pro for free for 1 year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'd love to hear what you think of the app and if there's anything else you'd like to see in it, the direct feedback with users has been amazing and has undoubtedly made the app what it is today.

Thanks again!"]}, {"title": "A New Defense of the Platinum", "body": "A little backstory. I'm 26, a paralegal making $50K, and a relatively recent Amex Platinum owner. This isn't a defense of using the Platinum with bad spending habits. No matter what the card, always pay on time and in full, make a budget and stick to it, and be honest with yourself. Rather, it's a new perspective on who the Platinum is for.\n\nWhen I was first looking into the Platinum, most every reviewer said one thing: *\"This card is only good if you're an active traveler or active duty military.\"* It's entirely true, it is a great card if you travel multiple times a year or can get the fee waived, but I also feel like it's great for someone that *wants* to travel more often. \n\nThe $695 AF is steep, yes, but I feel three credits can make the Platinum much more reasonable for even the average aspirational traveler: Uber, Digital Entertainment, and Saks. Using the Uber Eats credit for pickup nets me basically one free lunch each month to offset against the credit, something I would do anyway without it. It covers the cost of my SiriusXM and my Peacock (substitute your favorite streaming service either way), which is something I would be paying for anyway. Lastly, Saks. The only thing I would see myself purchasing at Saks would be cologne, but even if I wanted absolutely nothing, I could easily sell the gift cards for $40 a piece each year online.\n\n$695-200-240-80=$175. Still high, don't get me wrong, but significantly more reasonable. I use other credits too, but I feel like the vast majority of people can make use of those three at least. There's also the perks of purchase protection and cell insurance, but I digress.\n\nBut here's the thing about the Platinum. It makes me *take a break.* The $200 FHR credit? I used it to take a single-day staycation at a resort in my hometown and honestly? I can't tell you how refreshed I feel. I may not have stayed there initially, but I *value* that stay. It makes me excited to start my travel plans again and get out into the world. The complimentary Gold at Hilton and Marriott? It came through when I was exhausted on a road trip and got me an upgraded room unexpectedly. It turned an annoying trip delay into a genuinely enjoyable stay. Global Entry? Makes coming back stateside from Mexico a breeze so my fianc\u00e9e and I can spend more time with family. \n\nMy point is: The Platinum does shine when you can stay at airport lounges, get first-class flights at insane rates with your MR points, and show off by calling the concierge. But I feel like it also shines for a guy like me: someone who wants to travel more but hasn't been able to. It takes some discipline and I may not make use of all the credits in my day-to-day expected spend, but I can use them to enjoy some nicer parts of life, take a break from the grind, and look forward to traveling again. That's worth the $175 EAF to me.\n\nEdit: Clarification and grammar.", "id": "z1kjok", "upvotes": 169, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/amex/comments/z1kjok/a_new_defense_of_the_platinum/", "permalink": "/r/amex/comments/z1kjok/a_new_defense_of_the_platinum/", "comments": ["There's a thread way down below somewhere that got onto similar lines, but I'll reiterate because this post blew up.\n\nI didn't make the thread to justify it to myself.

After all, the solution we can find here is kindof inadequate for both of us really. \n\n> Everything that doesn't regularly move is hardwired here. \n\nI'm jealous. That's more hardware than I'm able to afford at the moment. I left my job when I got covid in March, so we've been making it work on my wife's income. I've had to be ruthless about getting the most from every device and cable in our possession. I'm using my 17 year old VGA monitor with over 80,000 hours working time so that I could give my wife my gaming monitor to WFH. I'm a firm believer in the power of duct tape and WD-40 and I like my devices to know who owns them til the day they die.\n\n> The more devices you have connecting on a given frequency the worse performance for EVERYTHING\n\nYes, absolutely. So, wouldn't powering down devices when they're not in use reduce the overall noise on your network? It's basically the first step of troubleshooting radio interference, unless you reach straight for the antenna (noooooo...).\n\nWifi works great for one device. It works half as great for two devices. It stops working well when you add more devices, and works terribly when they all talk at the same time. You can eliminate a lot of radio interference simply by powering down devices when they're not in use.\n\nI'm actually still looking into your initial question, and the deeper I go the more I'm coming around to your side of the debate. It would be awesome to whip out my phone and use the remote login features of my PS4 to turn it off if it loses mains power, but it would be even better to have it done automatically while I roll back over in bed. Unfortunately it seems if you use rest mode at all, you're stuck using it until you shut it down manually in person.\n\nIf you're still reading, I think a potential workaround to power down remotely might lie here:\n\n> If there are no check marks set under [Settings] > [Power Save Settings] > [Set Functions Available in Standby Mode], there is no need for Standby Mode and the system turns off completely.\n\nCan you turn off these settings remotely from the second screen app and trick the PS4 into powering down completely when it enters standby mode?", "Hey, awesome.

CSR will give a nice amount of points when you hit the sign up, plus 1 person gets global entry and pre check free. As long as your folks like to travel economy on free tickets, the CSR is the way to go. Amex cards earn more miles but I\u2019d say the amex route is more lux oriented with less usable features.

What *is* unusual is that they're apparently counting the Venture X's $300 travel credit and TSA PreCheck/Global Entry credits as \"income\". To get over $600 of \"income\" you had to have had some referral bonuses. For the Venture X, it sounds like they're valuing the 25k point referral bonuses at $0.010029 per point (according to a user comment on the DoC page -- how Capital One came up with this number I have no idea). So if you had two Venture X referrals totaling 50k, that's 50,000 * $0.010029 = $501.45, + $300 travel credit + $100 GE credit = $901.45 of miscellaneous income you get to pay tax on. \n\nThis is just mind-boggling. If this applies to you, all I can say is I suggest you call Capital One and ask why your travel credit and Global Entry credit are being considered income. \"Rebate on spend\" is a typical phrase used to justify why credit card sign-up bonuses are not taxed as income, and I struggle to see how the same phrase doesn't apply to these credits, given that you had to spend that much money to get them.\n\nRIP Capital One call center employees.\n\nEdit1: Despite my starting off by saying this won't apply to anyone who didn't get referral bonuses, it actually does, and it makes this situation even more messed up. Taxable income is taxable income, *regardless of whether you receive a 1099 for it*. So going by Capital One's messed up reasoning, anyone with a Venture X card who used the $300 travel credit in 2022 earned $300 of miscellaneous taxable income -- they just won't get a 1099-MISC for it if the total misc income isn't over $600 -- *but according to the law, you're still legally obligated to report such income on your income taxes*.

Paying down a revolving balance slowly over time \"builds credit\" faster than if you pay it down/off quickly:  In actuality, the exact opposite is true.  Carrying balances over time relative to paying them off monthly is a sign of elevated risk and not a positive look.  Elevated balances can also temporarily lower Fico scores, where paying those balances down quicker can restore Fico points lost due to elevated utilization more promptly.\n\n2.  You shouldn't \"use\" more than 30% of your limit:  Very common myth.  Some will even say 10% or some other low end percentage.  How much you \"use\" your limit is not a scoring factor.  Often I believe people are conflating \"use\" with \"utilization\" here.  You can use as much of your limit as you'd like.  What's most important is whether or not you pay your statement balances off in full every cycle.  If you do, you can \"use\" as much as you want and higher usage is actually better for such a profile in many ways.  EDIT:  You can always control your [reported] utilization by making a payment before your statement generates.  By doing so you are controlling utilization (which can temporarily impact your scores) where your usage is still the same.  You still \"used\" the same amount.\n\n3.  Closing a card hurts your credit:  The actual closure of a card in and of itself 99% of the time has no adverse impact on credit.  The exception here would be if it is one's only revolver, meaning they are moving their profile from possessing revolving credit to no longer possessing revolving credit.  Most of the time people wrongly believe that when you close a card you lose the credit history that goes along with it.  Closed accounts typically remain on your credit report for 10 years following closure and closed accounts are included in aging metrics the same way open accounts are.  Another common reference is the potential for utilization to increase due to the closure of a card because the credit limit lost from that card reduces TCL.  While this may be true and potentially impact scores, it would be the increase in utilization lowering scores and not the actual closure of the account.  \n\nI'm curious to hear what other common credit card myths you all think are perpetuated both on this sub and in general.  I've got a few other honorable mentions that don't make the top 3 IMO, but if they come up are certainly worthy of discussion as well.", "id": "10jy77t", "upvotes": 219, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/10jy77t/top_3_credit_card_myths/", "permalink": "/r/CreditCards/comments/10jy77t/top_3_credit_card_myths/", "comments": ["Don't go doing any bridge jumping or I'm going to have nobody to waste astronomical amounts of time with trying to make stupid people understand basic math. \n\nI did this all exactly the same way.

Aside from fucking Cap 1, who bucketed me on a venture at $7250, I always get astronomical CLIs with zero utilization and barely any use.  And Fuck Cap 1 anyway. \n\nAlso agreed on the incidentals.

You can feel the weight difference from the 'turbo, and the handling is much more direct and precise.\n\n991 GT3RS: Even more stiff, loud, extroverted styling with that wing. Engine wants to live above 5500 RPM. Great fun at the track, a bit out of its element for street driving.", "I sold my first Porsche (a 997 Turbo manual) at the end of 2021 when the market was so high, after six years of ownership. It was an 4th car for me, so I didn\u2019t really need to daily it. I sold it and I\u2019m now shopping for a 992 or 991.2 GT3. The Turbo was fast, don\u2019t get me wrong, but just like I\u2019m sure it is with a Tesla, the excitement of the straight line speed wears off after a while. I never found it nearly as exciting to dive as my Exige (which was a fraction of the cost). \n\nThe much lower redline of the Turbo and lack of exciting noise always left me wanting more. Plus in my opinion rear wheel drive is always more fun than AWD. Combine that with a manual option and for me it\u2019s an easy decision.\n\nI already test drove a GT3 and was immediately in love.\n\nSo, if you don\u2019t need more practicality go with the GT3 or GT3 RS for sure! I was really wanting an RS but then a drives manual GT3 and it is a truly sublime transmission.", "992 GT3 because you can drive it almost everyday and it\u2019s much more enjoyable than the turbo S in my opinion just feel wise. If you want the most power and straight line speed with comfort obviously turbo S but for me the choice would be simple and it would be 992 GT3 it\u2019s just perfect.", "If you plan on driving it at all - normally. GT3. I regret not buying the GT3RS purely because I have the pcar sedan and suv and could drive those while letting the RS be a pure track toy. \n\nI thought I would drive the GT3 more but NJ tries to intentionally break your suspension with its roads near the city. I had an order for the turbo s.  But those can always be bought.  If you have a chance or allocation for the 992 without ADM - hands down I\u2019d grab it.", "What a problem to have for your first porsche...\n\nIf its meant to be a daily car, the GT3 and 3RS wont hold value as good as youd expect. Itll stay high, but those first 20-30k miles are going to be really painful depreciation per mile. The market is flooded with so many ultra low mileage garage queens, high mileage is a red flag in the market. \n\nThe turbo, although will depreciate more each year, would be cheaper to drive daily from a depreciation per mile standpoint. \n\nIf you drive more than 10 miles a day on avg, I think the turbo is going to be the better bet in terms of both comfort and resale.", "Driven older gt3 and turbos. Don't even consider gt cars, especially not rs, if you are not planning on tracking it, or at least not use it close to resembling a daily driver. They are noisy, uncomfortable racing machines. Gt3 would obviously be a bit better than a rs for daily. However that's why they make the turbo s.\n\nIf you are going to take it out and playing with it at the weekends, and taking it to track meets, then gt3 or RS is perfect. Turbo s is to heavy for track use if you are serious about it. One thing I found with gt cars is that they need to be driven a bit more actively to get anything out of them, which leads to going way to fast on normal roads. Driven within the speed limit they tend to be just loud and annoying. \n\nI never go to the track so would take turbo s everyday. It's plenty fast on fun roads in the weekend and comfortable enough on highways.", "Choose the Turbo S, I have a 911 gts4. Once behind the wheel you will want to drive this car as often as you can. \nSo buy the Turbo S, then if you want to track a Porsche, trade it in or buy another. Driving a Porsche is like cocaine, one is to many and a thousand is never enough.", "I got to take a 991 GT3 off the lot for a day long test drive. I agree, and I feel it's the best of both worlds.", "Yeah this was my exact thoughts when I bought my GT4 recently ( my first Porsche) . I knew I wanted something with enough creature comforts to daily drive occasionally BUT still special and fun on weekends . Maybe a 911 when I go full old man \ud83d\ude02", "I would add that if you really long for a car with a manual transmission, the GT3 is for you (or maybe a GTS spec). Depends on what you plan to do with the car and how you plan to drive it. I have a 991.2 GT3RS, it\u2019s my forever car and I don\u2019t race or track it but man is it fun in the twisty roads of the north GA mountains. If 0-60 is your thing, the Turbo S abides and does it in comfort and style.", "You should stick with the turbo then,  and even consider the s, 4s if you want to have more fun with the car and stay out of jail.   The turbo just snaps to high speed without thinking,  and some argue too easy to drive fast,  maybe boring.   The base prolly the most fun in the street because of the level of engagement,  but only pdk.  The s has a manual.  I wouldn't buy a gt car for the street only.   As to resale, well, you shouldn't buy a porsche a an investment,  unless you're an n+1 owner and can get your hands on exclusives, and not drive them much.  Turbo s hold their value pretty well methinks.  993 turbos are like 200k nowadays."]}, {"title": "First Porsche - Cayman GTS", "body": "Always dreamt of owning a Porsche since I was a kid.

Reliability and unneeded financial burden scare the crap out of me. So going into this new stage of my life where I want to buy a 911 has given me some anxiety.\n\nMy first \u201cfun\u201d car was a 1977 MG. It was a cool little thing. But man, was it unreliable. Overheated a lot, left me stranded a few times. \n\nMy replacement for that was a 2015 NC generation Miata. That car has been delightful. Regular maintenance and upkeep is simple and straightforward. Its been a great companion. \n\nAs I look toward the future, I\u2019ve got my eyes set on a 911. I\u2019ve talked myself into it, I\u2019ve done some test drives. It\u2019s vibing. Specifically, there  are a few models that check the boxes: 997 S, 997 Targa (4 /4S), or a 997 4/4S. Pretty much any 997, minus the convertible. I like having the back seat to throw some stuff or have my dog ride with my partner and I. A 911 feels like a proper next step in sports car ownership.\n\nReasons for a 997: I had the most fun test driving a 997 S - it was all the upgrade from my Miata that I could ever desire. Lightweight, snappy, fun, and didn\u2019t feel overly powerful. Felt like I could push it, but it was forgiving. \n\nMy real interest is in a 997 Targa. It just feels like the perfect tourer coming from a Miata. There is a special factor to those and that\u2019s been compelling. Plus, where I live (Colorado) having the AWD and glass roof feel like a proper upgrade. Natural light and AWD means a bit more flexibility to cruise. But given their limited numbers, I\u2019ve not had the chance to drive one yet. \n\nNow here\u2019s the thing: the internet is loud and vocal about having a bad time. So that leads to a lot of noise about IMS issues and Bore Scoring. Both of which, remind me of my lack of fun in the MG. I\u2019ve done a good bit of research: 997.1\u2019s after 05 are in okay condition for IMS, but it still can happen in later .1 models. Bore scoring is also a troubling issue.  997.2\u2019s supposedly have both the issues nearly eliminated. \nI\u2019ve read that regular high quality maintenance seem to help decrease likelihood of both, but a 997 could still end up with either of those issues. \n\nWhat I\u2019m getting at: if I\u2019m so set on a 997, am I setting myself up for a bad time by looking at and considering 997.1 generation cars? Or should I be playing it safe and looking at the more limited 997.2 cars? Of course, 997.1\u2019s fit a lot better for a guys limited budget. But are my thoughts here rational? Are there other things I\u2019ve not considered?\n\n_Edit a day or so later:_ I just want to give huge props to this community and for being willing to have some good discussion here! I certainly have a \u201cplan\u201d going forward: I\u2019ll likely look for a 997.2 Carrera S. If a 997.1 Targa comes up, I\u2019ll give that some solid consideration. And I need to get some test drives in with a 996 Turbo and a 997 Targa to also continue to learn what I\u2019m leaning toward. \nBut at the end of the day, I think my fear of long term maintenance and financial woes kinda triumphs over my desire to just get one and drive.\n\nHope to update you all in the future with a new to me purchase.", "id": "12u85so", "upvotes": 17, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Porsche/comments/12u85so/first_time_997_buyer_struggles/", "permalink": "/r/Porsche/comments/12u85so/first_time_997_buyer_struggles/", "comments": ["997.1 I owned was a hoot to drive.  It had the convenience of a modern Porsche while reminding me of the air cooled versions.  Only you can decide whether or not to take a chance on engine failure.  Personally I would, especially if inspection comes out clean.  Maybe the higher mileage cars are less likely to have an engine failure?", "I went through the same journey as you. I was looking for a 997 because it was the best 911 look and drive wise in the modern area of Porsches. However, I was scared more for the bore scoring. This was going to be my primary car and I wanted it to be as reliable as a Porsche can be. I eventually looked at 997.2 but the prices they ask for those currently, you can get yourself a 991.1 base and S. I ended up getting a 991.1 c2s pdk and it\u2019s been quite a joy but it is a lot bigger and feels more of a touring sports car than a raw roadster sports car the 997 is. That\u2019s why I kept my s2000.", "Prestige on Colfax has a Targa 4S on the lot. Might swing by.\n\nYou don't need AWD so long as you run decent snow tires and don't drive like a fool. Take a sick day on bad weather days. My AWD only goes to the front if I start hooing around. Also don't limit yourself to a certain body, trim, color, etc. A white no option base is still a great car and upgrade from a miata. Just get the lowest mile, best documented one you can.\n\nMy first car was a 1980 TR7 DHC. I feel your pain and joy with british cars that overheat on a cold winter day.", "Others have shared their thoughts but I can't imagine a more bulletproof porsche (warranty cars not included) than a 997.2 manual. However, manuals are highly sought after and prices are high. Targa 4S manual I'm guessing is a 75K purchase unless it's got high miles which aren't really that problematic. \n\nI have a .2 and knew a fraction of this before buying and there are so many reasons I keep running into that make me happy to have landed on a 997.2S. That said, there are fixes for all the things, it's just a matter of how much risk you are willing to accept. I personally would not buy a .1S unless I planned to rebuild the engine, possibly increasing displacement. IMS does not scare me - it's a known cost and a relatively easy fix. Bore scoring is another matter and the causes of scoring in .1 motors are just not that well understood. On the .2 motors, you keep the RPM low until oil is hot and don't lug the engine. That's basically it. Drive the shit out of it apart from that. \n\nI'd say go find a nice newer Boxster S but you can't get those in AWD so that's not gonna work. \n\nGood luck either way, these cars are just a hoot to drive.", "IMS is so unlikely if: A) you do the retrofit if it's easy; or b) it hasn't happened yet.\n\nBore scoring: you can scope the cylinders before buying. If you discover it later, you have tens of thousands of miles before it's an issue, then you can drop in an Flat 6 Innovations rebuild to get way more speeding tickets! At least that's my plan.\n\nMy car has been super reliable, but I had to fix a door handle and the trunk latch. That's it in 30k miles. And I do not baby my car at all. It's a downtown daily-driver and I park it on the street.\n\n  \n\n  \n\nedit: you're right on the 997. My gf has a 996 and a 991 GT3 and she loves driving my 997. I have a DSC and Numeric SS in it that are both just fantastic.", "The best thing to do is buy and drive it to enjoy and live cheap for a few months after or before even. Set yourself up a nice slush fund and just add to it when and however much you feel is enough to cover a big expense. I mean they are aging well but things happen as you say, as with every car.", "I have a 997.1 C4S - I honestly never worry about bore score. If it happens it happens - my car is 16 years old now - any car of that age might need a rebuild and especially a sports car so I just drive it, have fun with it, revel in its beauty \ud83d\ude0d", "Owning a later 997.1 and now a 991.1 - I loved the 997, but the jump between the generations is significant - if you can swing it, do a 991.

I currently drive an Audi S6 and am looking at going electric.  I wanted something that was fun to drive and had good performance.  Until recently, I was looking at buying new, which meant that the Audi e-tron GT and the Taycan were out of my price range.  (If it matters, I was looking at the EV6 GT or the upcoming Ioniq 5N - obviously non-luxury, or potentially the Genesis GV60.)\n\nThen I got the idea to look into used Audi and Porsche models and some 2-3 year old models can be found CPO around 90-95k.  So, given that I am dead-set on my next car being electric, and wanting something that is fun to drive, am I crazy for considering stepping up to Porsche?\n\nAm I setting myself up for more expensive dealer service (even more so than what Audi would charge)?  I know with most electrics, it's just brake jobs and battery cooling system, but the Porsche and Audi models have transmissions, so those will require maintenance as well.\n\nEDIT: One more question, did the software updates enable Android Auto on pre-model year 2022 Taycans?  I can't stand Apple products and will never own one, so Android support is pretty important.\n\nAs an IT guy with a reasonably good salary (but definitely not doctor money), have I gone off the deep end?

I've had half a dozen Porsches ranging from \\~$50k to \\~$140k in value. After all this, I personally think the $60-80k price point is the sweet spot, as in that is what I paid for the cars I thought were the most enjoyable (and least stressful) to simply own and drive. You can get a lot of great cars in that range which are well along their depreciation curves and there are huge--*huge*\\--diminishing returns past that point. Putting my money where my mouth is: I've actually been divesting myself of the high dollar cars over the past year and consolidating down to about $70k worth of fun cars + a brand new (and still fairly inexpensive) daily driver.\n\nAlso, being your *first* Porsche, they're all going to seem pretty amazing. So I would go out and find something newish (2014+) for $60-80k. Another upside: no ADMs, no shopping around for allocations, no dealership fuckery, get the car tomorrow and just enjoy. In a few years if you still feel you want newer or more, re-evaluate.\n\nA car is a car. It's really a consumable, something you're going to use, which is going to lose value and efficacy over time. It will depreciate and suffer wear and tear. So, the way I look at is that even if you can technically \"afford\" it (e.g. paying cash outright, or easily servicing payments), if you can't also watch it burn to the ground and become completely worthless without suffering serious anxiety or damage to your financial well-being, you're *probably* spending way too much. That's obviously an extreme worst case scenario, because cars generally do have some (maybe a lot) of retained value and you will have insurance on top of that, but it is within the realm of possibility. Point being: if you pick up a ding in the parking lot, run over something or hit a pot hole, it'll bother you a lot less in your $70k 991 than it will a $150k+ 992 Targa.", "The cars sell themselves and holds value well. When a dealer has no salesmen in the parking lot, the demand will always be trending up. And all the Porsche dealers I\u2019ve been to does just that.

Unless it\u2019s to be driven everyday then a loan is fine bc it\u2019s used to make money. \n\nA typical 110k loan at a 6-7% interest (Hope not) for a 6 year loan may be ~38k extra. You could save that if it is paid outright bc of the uncertainty of the markets if you kept 110k in. Right now it seems to be doing better but leverage that in your thinking. \n\nNow if you don\u2019t have that 150k in cash or assets, don\u2019t buy please.

It has more low end torque, it\u2019s VERY noticeably faster 0-60, and the car feels lighter and more agile in general. \n\n4. I\u2019ve owned both manual and PDK Caymans. Personally, I prefer the manual in their naturally aspirated cars, but the PDK in their turbo cars. When you have a slightly slower and very linear power curve, the manual is super rewarding. \n\nWith the turbo engine, it I absolutely love how the PDK pairs with it. In normal mode, it mostly keeps the engine off boost and it\u2019s linear, quiet, and gets excellent fuel economy. Flip to sport or sport+ and it\u2019s just magic how the PDK always keeps you at the perfect RPM for max power. You could never shift as quickly or keep max boost as efficiently as PDK does. \n\nComparing the two cars I owned, I think the manual NA is an extremely rewarding weekend/track car. The PDK turbo is still a blast for those things (though admittedly less analog and connected) but it\u2019s such a better daily and so much faster. No regrets going from a 981 to a 718.

I wish it had a bit more power, but for me the S model wasn\u2019t worth the price jump. And as my first sports car (and stick shift) I didn\u2019t want to go too crazy in horsepower. \n\nOnly a few minor qualms: I\u2019d prefer knob infotainment controls like Mercedes over the touchscreen, power opening trunk/frunk would be nice, and the carpet is thin in a few spots.

You just don\u2019t get the motor eye candy. Visibility everywhere else besides the engine is far better in the Porsche.\nTry parking it in a crowded lot, or taking up a narrow mountain road. The pucker will get tiring on your cheeks. I\u2019m not sure what your use would be though.\n\nFrom the factory the 911 GTS chassis is setup for a broad spectrum. Its the car that\u2019s supposed to do everything well, the best compromise. \n\nIf you replace several components you can make your car feel much more track focused. Obviously that comes with trade-offs, but it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t mind them. \n\nI\u2019d recommend semisolid engine mounts but I assume yours are dynamic. The age of your motor and transmission mounts and the slop it creates makes the powertrain feel more detached. \nIntakes and exhaust won\u2019t get you any more power from your x51 engine without removing cats, but they will give you more buzz and feedback which you are desiring. \nIf you have a manual, the numeric shifter setup makes you feel like you\u2019re fondling the trans itself. If you have a PDK, a transmission flash (I\u2019ve only experienced Cobb) will make the car more aggressive all the time.\nYou\u2019d be surprised how spherical rear toe links make the powertrain feel more direct. \n\nIf you want eye candy, show off your brakes with a nice set of rims maybe?

I'm not a gearhead, I've only owned a handful of cars in my life, and this is just my subjective experience. I'm sure others will have a different take.\n\n**Purchasing Experience:** I knew I wanted an all wheel drive hard top convertible. I did a ton of research and solidly landed on the Targa 4S as the apple of my eye. I decided to pull the trigger in early 2021. I was totally ignorant of realities of allocations and post-COVID supply chain shenanigans. Imagine my surprise when my local dealer and was told they had no cars available and it would be 1+ years before I could get into a new car. I wound up calling 30+ dealers around the country looking for an allocation. No dice. I put my deposit down and got on the wait list with my local dealer. I politely but persistently followed up with him over the following months. Sometime in the middle of that year I got my timing right and the sales rep suggested he could get me an allocation if I was willing to pay above MSRP, I negotiated a bit with him but paid an absurd amount of mark up to get the car. I very much enjoyed the online customization process and wound up putting nearly every bell and whistle on the car available. It took about 6 months to produce and ship me the car. I received it in February 2022. \n\n2/5 - sales rep was fun to work with but probably price gouged me and while the wait is/was fairly standard for most desirable new cars at the time, it sucked.\n\n**Service Experience:** I've had a few minor issues with the car and brought it in for routine stuff (swapping seasonal tires in and out, oil change, etc.). By and large the service at Porsche has been awesome. You get a personal rep who actually knows who you are and helps track things for you, rather than having to use a faceless system. I can get the car in on short notice and they turn it around lightning fast. They do a great job with a complimentary in and out cleaning each time. My rep has even turned me on to a few after market options that I've taken him up on and gone above and beyond in a few ways. I had one small hiccup where they quoted a price on an alternative rim/tire package that was 4x more expensive than I was able to find independently. When I pointed that out they honored the lower price, but I couldn't help but wonder if they were trying to take me for a ride. \n\n4/5 - I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt of the one absurd price they quoted. Everything else has seemed reasonable (for a high end sports car) and the service quality has been excellent.\n\n**Aesthetics:** Sweet baby Jesus, this is a beautiful car. To this day I still find myself turning back to have a look at it and just generally really enjoying the unique look of the car, inside and out. The fact I was able to personalize so many elements of the design give me an added layer of personal connection to the car (\"this is my 911, there are many like it, but this one is mine\") that I really enjoy. \n\n5/5 - it's perfect\n\n**The Driving Experience:** Do I really need to suggest this car is fun to drive? It's incredible and this is unquestionably the biggest selling point of the car. Launch Control is a belly-laugh inducing blast every time I do it. The feel of the car in every scenario is just so spirited yet smooth. Even when I'm pushing extreme speeds (90+ mph) it feels comfortable. The high end torque on this thing and the ability to punch past people on the freeway is explosive. Those things I expected. What I didn't expect is how amazing this is when pushing through turns at pace. The grip this has on the road is astounding. It is very clear to me the abilities of this car surpass my abilities as a driver. I have no interest in testing the later, but it's a hell of a ride. \n\n6/5 - I can't imagine a better driving experience.\n\n**Practicality/Quality of Life:** So, this one was a pleasant surprise. I knew that a 911 would hold up better as a daily driver than a Ferrari, but I kind of thought I'd feel more of a trade off here vs a BMW M series of Mercedes C class. Personally, I find this car comfortable and flexible. To be clear, this is not a car that can travel with more than 2 people. It technically has a backseat but they aren't fit for humans. Outside that, it's amazing. The frunk is reasonably roomy and the back seats fold down for extra storage. I've actually managed to get 2 snowboards, 2 pairs of boots, and 3 bags in alongside another passenger. I've done 4 hour roadtrips in the car and never felt uncomfortable. The temperature control (with heated and cooling seats) is the best I've ever experienced. Putting the Targa top down has honestly produced some of the most magical driving moments in my life. It's works incredibly well as a year-round car. Winter tires and AWD have made it a happy little monster even in inclement weather, but it really shines in the summer with the top down and the music blaring on it's good-but-not excellent sound system. The intelligent cruise control and limited \"autopilot\" functions are awesome and massively helpful to limit stress in traffic. There are so many little grace notes (unlocking/locking automatically as you come and go to the car, choosing your own interior light color, cleverly hidden passenger side cup holder) that really round out the experience. \n\n4/5 - as far as high end sports cars go, this is a very practical car. \n\n**Digital System:** This... is where the car is a disappointment. The in-vehicle digital system is really glitchy. I've had multiple times where the satellite navigation gets knocked out of alignment and turn by turn navigation becomes impossible. I've had the Apple car play system just randomly stop connecting. I've had specific apps within the car play system stop working. It's just... not very good and it seems to have dumb little issues pretty frequently. Almost all of them require you turning off the car completely and leaving it off for a while so it \"resets.\" The issues are impossible to reproduce and talking to the service center they basically shrug their shoulders and go \"I know... it's not very good, but we can't do anything about it - they have to fix the software in Germany and make an update.\" The Porsche app on your phone is also really limited. You can see where your car is but that's about it. I would have really hoped for a remote start option, but for some reason that's not an option. Oh, and there is no physical key, just an RFID key FOB. Unfortunately if you leave the FOB inside the car it constantly drains the battery and once that happens you can't turn the car on, period. I've had to replace multiple FOB batteries before I figured that out and it seems like an incredibly dumb design. \n\n2/5 - for such an expensive car I would expect this system to be a lot better\n\n**Summary:** The car puts a smile on my face and a song in my heart every time I drive it. I love it and haven't regretted the purchase for a second. 4.5/5 - highly recommended, would buy again!", "id": "10ydkfl", "upvotes": 35, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Porsche/comments/10ydkfl/one_year_later_a_first_time_porsche_owner_review/", "permalink": "/r/Porsche/comments/10ydkfl/one_year_later_a_first_time_porsche_owner_review/", "comments": ["https://preview.redd.it/u98ke2ddndha1.jpeg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=985d1bdd97ce8b47d3f539348d6af20fb0dc747d\n\nI remember your post. It was a month before I got mine last year and sent my anticipation through the roof. 100% agree with your comments and observations! I\u2019ve had so many issues with Porsche connect they refunded the services. That\u2019s my only complaint.\n\nI\u2019ll add, I\u2019ve done 2600 mile road trips and the seat comfort holds up. And this car is every bit as stable at 140MPH as it is at 90MPH (was not on a public road). I\u2019ve had this car on two tracks and the idea of it being heavy and slow is unfounded (300lbs more than GT3). Both a pro cup car driver and a coach were astounded after driving it. These cars are so fast and dynamic I\u2019ve only used about 60% of the capability. I\u2019ve put over 20K miles on it in the past year and to quote Chris Harris, \u201cit\u2019s made every drive better.\u201d\n\nBest mods: Musicar Mosconi AB amp + Morel Elate speaker swap (only had base SPP, so major difference). Soul anti-drone exhaust completely changed the exhaust note from angry vacuum cleaner to grizzly race car rumble. Blendmount for a clean Uniden install.\n\nOnly 1 problem: the future! I don\u2019t see how someone could ever go to a coupe or cab after having a Targa. And that\u2019s probably how you end up with a garage full of Porsches.", "Thank you for this. This is exactly what I needed to get excited.  \nMy wife and I just signed for a 2021 992 targa 4s at the dealer, but aren\u2019t picking it up until later this week.  I couldn\u2019t sleep last night. Literally was up until 4am panicking, and wondering if we had made the right choice. Owning a Porsche has been a goal of mine since I was a kid. Years ago my wife agreed that I could have one for my 40th. I just turned 41 in January. Credit to my wife for making it happen. Otherwise it\u2019s unlikely I would have pulled the trigger just knowing myself. \n\nWe were looking at 2, a blue one with a manual, and a chalk one with a pdk. I would probably have gone with the manual, but it was priced way too high and the dealer wouldn\u2019t budge. Then we looked at the chalk one with a pdk. I generally don\u2019t care for chalk but the way it was spec-ed it looked great. Also while I know my wife was ok my buying the manual to achieve my goal, seeing how much more excited she got by the chalk one, and her being able to test drive it because it was a pdk has now made her super excited to get it also.\n\nBut back to your post. I\u2019ve loved the targa, but was concerned if I was making the right choice and it\u2019s a ton of money. But you put my mind at ease that we\u2019re making the right choice.  Now that the shock that we are actually doing this is subsiding I\u2019m getting excited. so thank you, Your post couldn\u2019t have come at a better time.", "Great review!

Also, a sincere thanks to the artist formerly known as Hacke, now @11erRennsemmeln for his openness to chat for months on end with some random internet person to help them spec out a car they weren't even sure they'd love.....I'm a mess sometimes, and I'm long winded, I know I know..  Nevertheless, a real big thanks to you.   \n\nStart with the spec and photos, finish with the story [get butts in seats, right?]:  \n\n* MY 2023\n* Shark Blue Cayman GT4\n* Satin Black wheels\n* Steel brakes (CCB were not available, I 100% would have checked that box if they were)\n* Manual Transmission\n* 18-way comfort seats with full leather seat shells\n* Leather interior with silver contrast stitching\n* Yellow centering stripe on wheel\n* Aluminum gas cap (LOL 11er...)\n\n\nI initially signed paperwork to order this car in March of 2020 at MSRP.   Yes, March of 2020.     But, the order was contingent on being able to pick the car up in Germany, which at that time was a non-starter (that little covid pandemic breaking out thing).    I knew it wasn't going to be a 'soon' thing, so working with the dealer at that time we planned for a Spring 2021 Euro Delivery.    Fast forward another 8-9 months, and we haven't turned any corner on the whole global travel front, Porsche still has not resumed European delivery for North America customers; and my financial situation feels somewhat more questionable than I felt if rewinding the clock 10-12 months; I needed to back out of the order.     \n\nI tried to ignore the car compulsion, and after about 6 months attempted to deflect it by opening another round of 'spending way too much modding the M3', which tamped the desire for only a couple of weeks/months at most.  I still had 'The Bug', but no beetle for me.   \n\nFast-forward to November of 2021.   I'm packing suitcases for an international trip, and planning 2 others for 2022 - seems like travel is back on the menu boys.  Finances feel back to a happier place for the most part.  Wife hasn't vetoed any of my hair-brained schemes lately; let's call Porsche.  First 'uh-oh'; the salesman I have been working with and referred to by a long-term client has left the region and is now with a P dealer 2,000 miles away.   Second 'uh-oh'; Rennlist is telling me that allocations will be hard to track down, there's not a lot of them being released.   I talk to my old salesman to see if his new dealership can process my order; unfortunately he has no allocations and doesn't have any idea when he'll see more.   Tells me to talk to a person at his old shop; my local dealer.   So, first call is made; and I'm a nobody, so there's definitely not a car for me.   I tried stopping in, talked with a guy who I think I 'looked familiar' to, mentioning I had a allocation but cancelled during Covid.  He tells me that he might have an allocation for the summer coming in - SCORE.   Let's see what's up.  Big 'uh-oh' time now.   The ask for a configurable build is $25k above sticker now!  What the F?  No better-half input needed, I'll veto that on my own behalf.    \n\nI think through this for a few days, not happy at all when it hits me.    The initial paperwork, signed, had no configuration on it no spec, and no numbers besides the model.  Only things stipulated were: \"718 GT4\", \"MSRP\", and \"Spring 2021 Euro Delivery\".  I take out my trusty copy of the purchase agreement and reach out directly to the local dealerships GM.   I explained the entire saga to him, trying to tug at heartstrings and casually reinforcing that I'm local and will service any car I buy with his shop, even willing to pay some ADM, but 25k is a non-starter (internally I would have been ok with 5K I think, but then the MSRP has jumped so much a 10k ADM for a MY2022 would have still saved me money).    We have a very nice 35-40 minute chat, and he promises that I'll hear back from him by end of week, but that is conveying no promise of a car.     \n\n2 days later; phone is ringing while I'm in a meeting.   I don't usually do this, but I excused myself to take the call.   \"Hello GM, how's it going?\"  \"Great here Rowanbuds, and your day is going to get better too.  We have an allocation for you, end of summer, and we'll keep the old deal in place.  Only problem I can't get it approved for Euro Delivery'.  After seeing the car market and availability over the past 2+ years, and all that time kicking myself for cancelling the order, it was a no brainer.  'I'LL TAKE IT' immediately.    And the real wait began.   \n\nStepping back for a minute, I'm coming into this from a European Delivered BMW F80 M3, specced out in individual Le Mans Blue Metallic - a 1 of 3 car in North America.  That car was my 'bucket list' thing, Euro pickup included, for the better part of a decade.  The day when I finally could sign the paperwork and make it happen is a highlight I think of fondly quite often.   \n\nThat M3 was good enough to stay in my life for 7.5+ years, which is saying something as before she arrived my longest held 'fun' car was a little over 2 years.   Many road trips, a good number of track days, and the car just took it all with a smile.  Never left me in a lurch, felt strong and tight until the day she was sold.  Granted, I didn't put a ton of miles on it (~42,000), but very very few of them were gentle.    In the entire ownership I can report these problems:  A fouled plug in Cylinder 5 at about 20k miles and a minor turbo inlet seal seeping found at around 25k miles, and fixed with no ongoing concern.  Just as importantly, when the new owner took posession, I still was doing 'the look back', thrilled to pieces with how the car looked.  And, that's why there's not another M3 coming into my life; for me, if I'm writing the check, I need to LOVE the way a car looks.  Not 'like', not 'I can deal with it', or 'if you don't look from this angle, it's fine' - if I'm willing to accept that, I'll buy an accord or camry and live dull with equal parts of 'little joy and fun, but also little costs'.   So, for about 2 years I had been expecting to replace my F80 with a new G80 once the mid-cycle refresh came out.  You can probably guess, as soon as I saw the new M3 in the metal I was scrambling to come up with a backup plan.  Enter....Porsche.  \n\nWhile I made incredible memories with the M3, that old saying about 'you don't know what you don't know' is rearing its' head terribly to me right now.    After just 400 miles on my 718, I sent at least 3 text messages yesterday to the effect of 'I should have bought a manual 15 years ago, and should have bought a Porsche 8 years ago'.   It's incredible, even keeping the tach on the low-end and trying to respect break-in recommendations.  \n\nBeing honest I ordered this as a half-measure to my own desires.  I really wanted to get a 991.2 GT3 but couldn't find one anywhere near my budget, certainly so in a spec or condition I'd be happy with.   Added in, my mind and emotions told me that I needed a 3 pedal car, but I've never had one before..  What if I hate it?  What if I just don't ever 'gel' with the car?  What if it's not enjoyable to me for my typical recreational driving use?  All worries that are hard to ignore when you're getting ready to drop 150-200k USD.     My gambit was this; Order the GT4 in manual.  You'll have some time to evaluate.  If it's not for you, you can likely sell it and not lose too much on the car - and the trade-value should get you into a well kept 991.1 PDK GT3; basically a minimal loss gamble in my mind if it came down to that.    \n\nI'm really happy to say, granted I've had the car for 2 days, that I am in love with the manual.   I have not had this much joy or engagement driving a car in over 20 years.    I took to the gearbox like a duck to water; yes it's definitely more tiring to drive than my BMW was - but that's part of this learning experience, and a huge portion of the long-lasting love I expect to have for this car.   Once spring/summer get here there's still a chance I don't find myself in head-over-heels love for the Cayman platform, but at least I know for sure now that I won't entertain swapping into a PDK GT4 or GT3.\n\nI've been getting box after box arriving at the house with car parts; I feel like I'm 8 years younger again :).   Car has had the JCR full titanium exhaust fitted already.  Entire car is protected with clearbra and then topped with a ceramic coating to help make cleanup easier.   I also had the 'PORSCHE' lettering laid on the wing in a curve to match it's profile, as well as had satin black '4.0' end-plates done on the wing.   I think it came out GREAT!  Thankfully..\n\nFor now the car will not get driven too much, winter is setting upon us here in the Northeast.   I'll take it out if temps above 40 and no salt or moisture on roads, trying to get the break in mileage behind me.   I drove the car home from my detailer on Sunday and then took the day off yesterday to drive - ODO has about 420-430 miles on it now.  I'm hoping to get the rest of these light miles done over the coming weekend, to then have her oil changed and leave it alone until spring shows us warmth.  \n\nThanks for sticking with me this long for those who had the patience, I'm a rambler - I know.   Anyway, I'm super excited to finally be a part of the P-car family even if the community involvement seems at least a couple steps below the BMW world I'm more familiar with.    The car will only have a few options for disposition now.   Either it's sold as part of my estate, or it's sold when my dealer calls with an at-MSRP GT3 allocation that I can pick up in Stuttgart.", "Congratulations man.

Maybe eventually a new age Tesla shaver if I were feeling flashy.  \n\nI have two self rules for the times I\u2019ve spent what was foolish money on a typically depreciating asset.  A. I need to drive the damn thing.  I didn\u2019t buy it to trade or sell a brand new car in 1\u20132-5\u201310 years.  I take great care of my cars, but they\u2019re bought to be used.

I used to date a girl who drove a manual car that I'd borrow here and there for a few hours (We ended things way back in 2005....).    Aside that, I rented a minivan for 1 afternoon in France about 4 years ago that ended up being a manual transmission.     And one to three sub-10 mile test drives in cars over the past decade.   That's the extent of my manual driving really, up until this thing waltzed into my garage.  :)  I'm thrilled.", "Thank you for the very kind words!  Hahaha, we're kind of similar for sure there; I added a G05 3 years ago, after I got disgusted by the G80 leaks, I started to think my path was to add a gently used F90 comp when my G05 lease ended; the crazy ass car market that we had all summer did not agree with my plans, so I ended up buying out my lease.     I have to love the car if I'm spending mortgage and home down-payment #'s on it; that's a non-negotiable to me.    And I really love the F90- I still may decide to turn my X5 into one if we see a big auto market correction by 2024.  Enjoy the crap out of it, I frankly don't think there's another car that I'd pick first for a coast-to-coast drive if needed.   \n\nWell, maybe a 992 TTS.......because that thing is INCREDIBLE.  Congratulations to you on the new pickup, what a beast that car is.   And way way more competent as a drivers car than the pure sledgehammer that was the 991 generation TTS.  Your 992 is so much closer to the GT car ethos than its predecessor, I'm the one who's a bit jealous in this exchange for once :) \n\nBest of luck with it, enjoy the new arrival - I'm sure you would with or without my input!   Great taste too, btw! :cheers:", "There's definitely something in the universe that doesn't want you and I to get each others' notifications for some reason.....\n\nI'm just seeing your response here now.  Thank you again for the insight through the months.   I'm so happy with how the car turned out, though my second/third guesses on color choice aren't dissipating much.  The flat non-metallic seems to show EVERYTHING on the surface, and I've got the feeling my compulsions for car condition will make this grate on me over time.  Until then though, I'll drive the pants off of it!  \n\nI'm happy with the black wheels too, even though CCB's being available would have made keeping them clean much easier.  Maybe happy finding for you, but I've got a set of silver wheels with All-season rubber that will go on the car this weekend, will look very different (OZ Leggera's). \n\nI intend to be well above the average owners miles through my ownership, driving it will not be a problem.  The days where I can't drive it, however; those are already difficult..  the car has its' hooks into me.    I make the GT3 commentary partially in jest partially as a wish; if I were to get a slot, after dreaming for years, I think I'd have to make the jump.  But that's not doing anything to diminish the joy I'm finding with the 718.   It's INCREDIBLE.  I should have jumped into a GT product years and years ago, I can't believe how much I enjoy it.  And same for finally buying a 3 pedal car; I should have done this decades ago.  \n\nAs you already know too well, I'm over-the-top verbose most times.   I'd think it a safe bet to expect an ownership review from me in the next 6-8 months or so. :)\n\nThanks for the alternate perspective on the community. Being honest, that's a big thing that turned me off to the BMW world over the last 4-5 years.  It became too 'hype-beast' and 'look at me' for my tastes.   A bunch of owners cruising for 90 minutes on the highway to go stand in a parking lot together looking at the same group of mass produced cars.   I just want to drive them, I already know how it looks......   But, I digress.  I intend to participate in the P community just the same.  When joining with a Porsche club group for HPDE some years back I found all of the P-drivers to be welcoming and friendly, antsy to share their input and opinions.   I think you're right, it's just about connecting with the right ones.  \n\nHappy driving, keep the shiny side up; and I ask that we all cross our fingers for a mild winter so that I can enjoy this car as much as I want to over the next 3 months.   Thanks again, for everything.  I'm sure we'll see each other around these parts soon enough!", "Love the story, congrats to you and your early enjoyment.

Sports cars need smaller batteries, won\u2019t drive as many miles as they\u2019re more likely a weekend car. It allows the manufacturers to start engineering batteries R&D up. 2030s will probably see an EV begin to takeover at scale with big SUVs, with climate change solidifying the disdain against ICE - I imagine by then people will have fully experienced and realized how much better EVs are as an appliance as well. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is what it takes to completely stop manufacturing of ICE. 911 EV will be last, they said, it wasn\u2019t ever a question of if.

One dealer specifically which is really close does not even list the packages it comes with, they are all listed as Base model but nowhere near MSRP.\n\nThere is a used 2021 Base model with 12k miles for 53k and a 2019 model with 20k miles for 48k. \n\nThese are certified pre-owned. Would I need to worry buying used? I intend to keep the car until it has at least 100k miles or so on it. Pretty much what I\u2019ve done with all my cars that I\u2019ve owned.\n\nWith the 2023 models they don\u2019t even have the options I want and I\u2019m not asking for much: Heated seats, moonroof, and maybe the partial leather seating, I don\u2019t need the 14 way seats or the colored Porsche logo or a tow hitch like some of the dealers have in the 2023 models.\n\nAlso how will I be treated at the dealership pulling in with a Mazda ? I read some horror stories of people being ignored because they didn\u2019t look like they could afford the car.\n\nSeems like each Porsche dealer has different loan percentage rates too. \n\nDo people mostly get their own financing? \n\nFrom my credit union I can get 5.2 for 72 months or 4.9 for 63 months new, and 5.4 for 2019 and older.\n\nEDIT: Ended up getting a 2021 CPO Macan. https://www.reddit.com/r/Porsche/comments/10c3y7i/new_macan_owner/", "id": "zyc3t3", "upvotes": 9, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Porsche/comments/zyc3t3/potential_first_time_owner_what_to_expect_at/", "permalink": "/r/Porsche/comments/zyc3t3/potential_first_time_owner_what_to_expect_at/", "comments": ["Buy the newest CPO you can afford without struggling, also if you plan on dealer servicing keep in mind it will be nearly triple or more what the 6 cost.

We get along on many levels, but he seems highly critical of how I spend my money. \n\nFor some background information, we live in NYC (I grew up here and he moved here from SF). We both make 6 figures. I live with my parents to save money in order to buy my own property, while he lives in a tiny studio in an upscale neighborhood. I save/invest as much as I can and have no debt at all. \n\nFrom the beginning, he told me he doesn\u2019t like spending money on expensive things and food because he wants to save money to buy property here one day. Our dates have never cost over $40 for the both of us, which I don\u2019t care about at all because we always have a good time. However, I noticed he makes a lot of comments and inquiries about what I spend my disposable income on. \n\nFor example, he asked me how many handbags I have and how much they cost. I told him I have 4 (3 ranging from $150-$200 each and a backpack) and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a lot, to which he replied he thinks is a lot. I also have mild rosacea on my face and get laser treatments 3 times a year. I was open with him about it and he asked how much the treatments cost. I told him it\u2019s $300 per session and would rather not spend money on it, but it helps my skin a lot. He implied that I was wasting money on it. He would ask how much my jewelry cost. I told him most are gifts from my mom and grandma and I only bought myself the earrings I was wearing that day, to which he wanted to know how much my earrings were. In the beginning, I thought they were just normal conversation topics, but now I\u2019m not sure if this will spiral into something bigger if we continue seeing each other or getting more serious. \n\nOur lives are not intertwined yet and we are not official yet and he is already making comments on how I spend my money.

If he didn\u2019t see you as LTR material, he probably wouldn\u2019t care as much. He may have recently been in a relationship where the spending habits on the other side were completely out of control, he may have grown up where spending on anything but necessities was a way of life by design and its engrained in his psyche. \n\nMy ex wife had \u201csecret\u201d credit card debt that came out in divorce proceedings and I had to shoulder half that post divorce.

I don\u2019t ask what things cost, but I keep an eye on bad habit patterns as a flag. \n\nBottom line, I would say orange flag and ask him why this is so important - if the answer has some merit linked to past experience than you can politely ask him to stop and maybe he will. If he doesn\u2019t, than it turns to a red flag.", "Criticizing you after only a month is a sign of more criticism, lack of respect, and control issues to come imo.

It's none of my business and if they want to willing me tell me, then fine.\n\n Ironically though, my best friend is also the type of guy who has no problem asking others how much they make, or how much things cost - which I find extremely weird and imo, very insecure. Which leads me to your case. This guy seems incredibly insecure about his financial state more than anything else. \n\nSo ask yourself this. Do you really want to get into a relationship with a man who is undoubtedly going to question every little (or big) purchase that you spend your OWN money on, constantly?

Maybe he might change with a promotion and more disposable income, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s living a bitter existence and it shows. \n\nHe needs therapy. Plain and simple.

I was in a relationship for almost 10 years. My now ex, also made good money but was very frugal. I ended up paying a for mostly everything (all our vacations, dates, fine dining). I didn\u2019t want to give up the things I enjoy and he wasn\u2019t going to pay for it. He grew up in poverty and his views on finances were totally different. He said he couldn\u2019t justify spending money on those things that weren\u2019t necessary. I felt hurt, like it was ok for me to spend my money on the things we both enjoy but he wouldn\u2019t offer to help out. My ex loved those costly things too, but at my expense. He would suggest fine dining restaurants and ask for expensive things for his birthday. 2 months prior to the breakup he had asked me if I wanted to go to Vegas since we hadn\u2019t been on vacation that year. I said sure but I need you to help pay for it, either the hotel or airfare. That was the last he ever brought that vacation up. This was the first time in 9.5 years I asked for his help paying because he had been particularly critical of my spending lately since we were looking to buy a home together. \n\nI just felt I was expected to always use my money for us, but then I would get criticized for my spending  that was for us.\n\nThere were of course other issues in our relationship but my spending habits was an major issue for him. \n\nHave a discussion with your boyfriend. If you aren\u2019t willing to curtail your spending and he isn\u2019t able to understand that this is your money/accept your spending maybe it\u2019s a dealbreaker. \nDifferences in how to handle money will lead to bigger issues in spending when it comes to vacations, buying vehicles together and a house.", "To me this is a HUGE red flag.

Sometimes people are just blissfully unaware of how behaviors they exhibit affect other people, and he might be reading the situation differently. Just based on the background you provided, it sounds like money comes up as a conversation topic and maybe he feels this is an extension of that not realizing it\u2019s violating one of your boundaries in the current state of your relationship.

It is something that can be corrected fairly easily, but seeing how early your relationship is you might want to weigh if its a path you want to walk with him.

On paper he's a good catch and people would say hes doing better than most men in NYC. But now you see why he is still on the dating market.

This will only get worse for OP if the relationship progresses. I have lived this - it\u2019s a miserable existence. She sounds very fiscally responsible and this dusty man sounds controlling.\n\nEdit: clarity", "I am going to have to agree  with  you on this. He has already revealed what it is going  to be like in a full-blown relationship", "I was in a relationship with a woman who was like this. She complained constantly about my spending habits and other things. I'm so happy I ended it. \n\nThis woman should do the same, it will only get worse with this guy.", "She's going to be miserable in this relationship. Might as well end it now. And he is going to be single or having a hard time maintaining relationships because of his weird ways.", "That seems like a really difficult situation you were in, really unbalanced and disrespectful of your financial generosity to nurture and support that relationship. I\u2019m sure it was incredibly painful and difficult to break away after so many years together but hope it feels better for you now. Treat yourself to happy moments without feeling judged, without looking over your shoulder or feeling like you are being taken advantage of.", "Well said, all around. Personally, I prefer to keep it balanced. I don\u2019t overspend, and I live within my budget. I generally save money for two reasons: the future/emergency fund, or vacations/experiences. I have a young daughter, and I\u2019m raising her the way I was - traveling over toys. We\u2019ve had some great traveling experiences, and she has priceless memories. I\u2019m not opposed to her having material things, but I don\u2019t spend a ton of money on toys that she\u2019s going to outgrow. That feels like a waste, to me. \n\nBeing frugal isn\u2019t bad; however, like anything, there\u2019s a tipping scale between frugal and being cheap. I dated a guy I thought was frugal, but, ended up being very cheap. He invited me on vacation, and I wound up paying for the first hotel we stayed at. It was more expensive, and much nicer. We also stayed for four days. He paid for the second one; two days, and not all that great. I have spend my life traveling; everything from campgrounds to five star hotels. I\u2019m very adaptable (think hostels in Europe). But, the room he paid for was a total dump. The view was the parking lot. Also, he *asked* that I help pay for parking, and groceries. M\u2019kay - I didn\u2019t ask for a dime from him (for the first four days). I\u2019m fairly certain I covered about 85-percent of the costs, overall. Suffice it to say, that relationship did not work. I\u2019m all for being practical, but I don\u2019t tolerate being taken for granted. Also, I do not mind splitting costs for vacation expenses \u2014 but, this was a whole other level.  \n\nSo, knowing there\u2019s a fine line between the two, I would encourage the OP to think about this. Carefully. Telling someone how to spend their own, hard-earned money is a bit much. Inquiring about the costs of inherited jewelry is just poor taste/low class. That\u2019s just as tacky as asking someone how much they make, or how much money they have. I grew up old school European; one did not inquire about religion, politics, or money. It was considered offensive. \n\nMoney is the number one reason couples divorce. I\u2019m a proponent for being on the same page, but this scenario doesn\u2019t seem sustainable (long term). I also worry that this guy may not be frugal; rather, he has financial issues or trauma surrounding money. Hear me out: my friend dated a guy who claimed to be frugal. He often inquired about her financial status, which was very stable. They dated for six months, and she found herself funding their ventures (dinners, trips, etc). Once they broke up, she discovered he had by lying. He was unemployed, and living off a trust fund (in his 40\u2019s). He depleted the trust fund, and ended up living with his sister. She dodged a major, financial liability. This guy would\u2019ve drained her - no doubt. \n\nWhen people act like this, I often think about the experiences she and I had. These weren\u2019t guys who had normal relationships with money - they had deeply rooted issues with it. I think I\u2019d take a hard pass on this scenario. My two cents.", "I\u2019d nip it in the bud Asap and if the end of that conversation means this thing is over then cool. Once in a relationship you\u2019ll probably feel like you have a mini accountant tallying up your purchases and making remarks. And that only increases the more serious you get and increases his confidence in being more critical as you\u2019ll then possibly start pooling money together. \n\nDepending on how often this is happening I\u2019d just say some version of \u201cok, these unsolicited opinions on how I choose to spend my money seem to garner opinion from you, so just so we\u2019re on the same page, is this something you\u2019ll continue to do, because I make my own money and just like you eat out a lot I also spend my money within my budget on things I like\u2026so it\u2019s kinda for me to figure out what\u2019s a lot and too much. No big deal but I\u2019ve noticed it and want to reference it as I don\u2019t require commentary on my expenditure\u2026I promise I can manage my spending more than ok\u201d", "This  guy is is a walking red flag.  He's critical of everything money wise.  He makes you feel bad for taking care of yourself.  I raised 2 daughters who now are adults.  Being a woman costs money.  I would seriously consider ending this relationship.   You want a guy who builds you up and supports you.  Not someone who is critical of every penny you spend.", "If his habits are none of your business then your habits are none of his business. He has no right to criticize you. If you continue a relationship with this man you can expect to have him judging you about your life choices.", "Just keep in mind that ~50% of people who make six figures are living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThis is because MOST people will live financially at a level proportionate to their income. Meaning if they make $100,000 then they spend X on non essential things. If they make $200,000 then they spend 2X on non essential things. If $300,000 then spend 3X etc\u2026..\n\nHaving money to spend is nice, but that doesnt mean you NEED to spend it. Finding a balance between enjoying your money and maintaining 100% frugality is pretty tough for most.\n\nHis view of your expenditures MAY be like if YOU looked at a person who buys 30 new handbags($400 ea) every single year when they only make as much as you do.\n\nMight seem like overkill right?\n\nFinances are super important in a real relationship so coming to a good compromise and understanding where the other person is coming from is imperative.

Any other women, usually I end up flirting with them or going on a date with them, anyways, get to know women in a group. They're bunch of activity groups out there, you want a gem go join a volunteer group and you'll find a cute girl with legit dreams and goals.

Once you accept that, then you weigh the pros and cons. The cons outweigh the pros significantly, so therefore you just tell yourself that wasting your time dating probably isn't worth it and it's better to focus on yourself, your family, and your true friends.

You could have been in one ten years ago, and you can be in one ten years from now. The only thing that's preventing you from being in one presently is yourself.\n* I walk around in public and I see all kinds of people in relationships \u2014 I see conventionally attractive people, I see fat people, I see geeks, I see elderly couples, I see goths. And, yes, I even see ugly people dating other ugly people (and sometimes I even see hot people dating ugly people).\n* The point is: There's no barrier to entry to be in a relationship. There's literally someone out there for everyone. What most terminally single people are really saying when they complain about being single is that they don't actually want to date the people who would be open to having a relationship with them.\n* There are millions of people in this world older than you who have never been in a relationship. Why do you need to overcome anything?...\n* Finally \u2014 I had a handful of puppy love relationships when I was a teenager in high school. But afterwards, I was single for 12 years. In that time I got scouted to be a model, did a lot of stage productions, made a lot of friends, did a ton of networking.

You need to take risks, put yourself out of the comfort zone and try. Try approaching with the mindset that she may very well reject you. Online dating has ruined many facets of human connection, but one thing I know for certain, women do enjoy a genuine person coming up to express interest. Here's something that happened to me the other week:\n\nI'm sitting in a food court with my mother and brother. We're taking a break from helping move our mother into her new apartment. In between bites of my ridiculously cheesy philly steak sandwich, I notice a woman sitting by herself, reading a book. Visually, she was my type, and my intuition told me I should approach (something that rarely happens). \n\nShe was about 50' away so I needed a better look, to assess how I could open the conversation without seeming weird or creepy. I had to walk by her in order to throw my trash away, so I did. As I walked by, she looked up, our eyes meet, we smile simultaneously at each other. That was an indication that approach would be alright. \n\nI rejoined my family and decided I would go for it before we left, and before I talked myself out of it. \n\nI got up, and started over to her table. In my head I'm spinning, ignoring the silly pickup lines, and whatever other ADHD word vomit. I'm trying to make a simple, effective and innocent conversation opener that would also not be too complicated that I get tongue tied.\n\nI approach. Here's how it went:\n\nMe: Excuse me, I'm sorry to interrupt you but are you single? (Straight to the point - this way she has the option to use 'I have a boyfriend' or 'no' as her rejection line) \nHer: *caught off guard* Hi, uhm yes, I am actually. \nMe: Are you open to exchanging Instagrams and getting to know someone new?\nHer: *thinks for a moment* Yea, let's do it. \n\nI ask if I may sit for a moment, we have about two minutes of small talk - I'm full of glee and fighting to contain my excitement. Now I'm looking for an exit as to not take up too much of her time, and to not look like a goober. \n\nMe: Well, I'm helping my mom move today, so I should get back over to my table, but I couldn't not come and say hi. I'll give you a text later if that's alright. \nHer: oh, I'm waiting for my grandparents. They're meeting me for lunch before they fly home. Sounds good\nMe: awe, that's a wholesome afternoon, enjoy your lunch. \n\nWe exchange goodbyes, and I get up and rejoin my family. \n\nI was extremely nervous and I'm usually a pretty confident guy. But I was expecting her to say she had a boyfriend or outright reject me. Not the case, so it does work out sometimes. \n\nWe talk everyday and are getting to know each other slowly. I relayed the story to some of my women friends from high school and they agreed that they wished men would come up and talk to them. \n\nGo make mistakes, go and try, fail and try again. It's good for you and you might end up with an unexpected personal victory and who knows, a relationship. \n\nGood luck", "Im not sure if this would exactly help you as it did with me.

So they may not really love her, but overstate their feelings to get laid for a semi serious relationship, that being said it doesn't mean they don't like the girl or that they won't stay together long term, only that they're first intentions weren't a long term relationship and they overstated their feelings.\n\nBut in the end I think both will be rather uncommon, if not outright rare.

To answer your question, yes it is possible, and the avoid this possibility there are a few things you need to factor in when a guy asks you out, such as how long/well you know eachother. There was a dark moment in my past where I tried this exact thing with a partner, where I attempted to manipulate them into performing sexual acts with me before breaking up with them, but after I had a moment of self reflection, I realised what I was doing and broke it off before I might relapse. As a scummy person myself, I can say that if a topic of sexual nature, be it in joke or serious conversation, tends to come up in conversation frequently/repetatively, then that is absolutely a red flag, so in turn, you should be the one to be clear about your own boundaries, be honest about what you want in a serious, private conversation between just you and your partner, and if they break those boundaries repeatedly or in an extreme manner (accounting for *maybe* an accident or flirt that just wen't to far, in which case, just be sure to re-affirm your boundaries) then you should absolutely take that as a sign that they may be trying to use you for sex.\n\nTldr: be clear, be firm, be honest, and don't be afraid to break if off if you aren't comfortable.", "My friend was dating a guy for three years and when the relationship ended this guy explained to her he used to be in love with her, but they lost the spark and he basically only kept her around for sexual pleasure in the end.

There is no \"one weird trick\" or relationship rule or self-discipline exercise that will sort all the sex-wanting men from the relationship-wanting men.\n\nThere is nothing, absolutely nothing, you can say or do or think or believe that will sort the men into those categories. \n\nThat being said... at least you can sort the stupid, impatient, or tactless ones out. Then you just get more patient, and/or more intelligent men who will ghost you--and honestly, between the stupid men and intelligent men, I'd much rather deal with the smart guys.\n\nDon't go into dating being suspicious and untrusting of the people you're going on dates with. Let them show you what sort of person they are through their actions first, their words second. If you don't like what you see them doing or hear them saying, move on; if you like what you see or hear, then stay on a bit.\n\nDon't go into dating with self-limiters. \"No sex until third date\", \"no kissing until second date\", \"no sex until marriage\", \"holding hands/side-hugs only\" blah blah blah. ONLY if you would act that way with EVERYONE, then sure go ahead--at that point it's not a self-limitation, but a personality trait. If you'd totally sleep with that charming, handsome guy on the first date, but your friend or the internet said \"sleeping with a guy on the first date only makes them run\"? That's a self-limiter. Sleep with that guy (if the attraction is mutual, obviously). If he decides to run or ghost after, that's a mark of HIS character and poor choices--NOT yours! YOU wanted the cake, so you bought the cake--is it your responsibility if he was a bad cake? No! You take that sucker back to the store and demand a refund.

Generally speaking, they already know they're attracted to the woman before they get into the date--sex is already on the mind. Not all men though, of course; herein, I'm just discussing the vast majority, for the sake of the comment. Anyway: if a man chooses to go on a date with a woman, he is already willing to be physical with her. Whether or not he wants to *date* that woman, like on a continual and bf/gf basis, is up in the air and varies from man to man. There's no way of knowing, because THIS is what differs from man-to-man; and like I said the first time, every man knows what they want before they go on the date. \n\nGenerally, a man won't know if he's gonna get lucky that night. The woman knows whether he will or not. A woman, on the other hand, won't know if the man is truly interested in a relationship--whereas the man knows whether it'll end up that way or not. \n\nShit sucks, but that's reality.", "I mean I feel like the type of person who would ghost after lying about a relationship would just keep the relationship as a sudo bootycall", "A lot of relationships have formed by guys trying to get into a girls pants.

Presumably she found the person she hooks up with physically attractive then I'd wonder if she is vetting me for other qualities to see if I \"make up\" for it with other qualities and traits (I don't want to be in a relationship where the person I'm with is with me despite my attractiveness if that makes sense).  I'd never ask this stuff directly obviously...I'm aware that it wouldn't go over well and odds of me getting an honest answer are also slim to none.\n\n I'm trying to find an equivalent for women as to how they would feel and the only thing I can think of is if a guy you were seeing for 5 months is still in a \"situationship\" with you and is waiting to commit, but you find out his last two long term relationships he was exclusively dating them after a few weeks...in that scenario I'd naturally ask why we're they worthy of commitment and I have to wait.  Similarly since women are the \"gatekeepers\" of sex I'd wonder the same.  \n\n\n>People do also change. A woman might have had casual sex in the past, but doesn't enjoy it in her current mindset and therefore wants to build a proper connection first.\n\nI think I'd ask (not actually ask but wonder in my head) what made her change her mind and if that change is sustainable or not.  \n\n>Or even that they didn't wait previously and found themselves being ghosted after sex, so decided to start waiting to reduce the chances of that happening.\n\nI'd then ask the question (once again not actually ask but wonder in my head) a.)

That's why it seems like a game to men, women intentionally withhold it because they think it gets them commitment...making me wait doesn't increase the odds that I commit. \n\n>So we decide if we like you enough for long term then yes we do wait.\n\nI get why you all do it, I just don't see the benefit from my end...the man you want a real relationship you make intentionally wait while the man you presumably don't deem worthy of a relationship doesn't have to wait.

This is no different than if a woman was in a situationship for 6 months and wants commitment and the guy is intentionally waiting then you found out his past relationships were all exclusive after a few dates...obviously that woman should leave that situation and want better for herself...it's not her deserving something. Same thing here I want better for myself.\n\n>What that does is it turns women into performative actions that fulfill your desires, because you deserve it. \n\nIt's not about deserving anything...I don't deserve anything I am simply saying I wouldn't seriously date anyone who is not meeting expectations...I'm not saying I expect anything. \n\n>f one woman won\u2019t play, you\u2019ll find another.\n\nThat's generally how dating goes, if one person does not meet your standards you find one that will...there is nothing wrong with that and this is independent of gender. \n\n>It isn\u2019t even focused on mutual fulfillment, because this hypothetical woman obviously doesn\u2019t want to.\n\nThat's fine...I'm not sure why this is an issue...if she doesn't want to then obviously that's her prerogative.  I never said otherwise...I simply said I wouldn't seriously date them. \n\n\n>Therefore, whether or not it was your intention to send this message, you are saying that if she won\u2019t do what you want, you\u2019ll leave and that is an extremely important point to understand. \n\nThat's true with any dealbreaker right? If they don't meet your standards/expectations you leave and anyone should...this is independent of gender too women should do the same.  I'm not sure what's the \"extremely important\" point here...it's not like I'm giving an ultimatum and being like \"I need sex or ill leave\" I'm simply leaving.  \n\n>Another point to be made is that you are already coming from the assumption that she owes you an explanation and her sexual history and how she has handled past relationships. She doesn\u2019t\n\nI never said she owes me anything, I made that very clear...no one is owed anything so I'm not sure why you are using that language when I explicitly said I'm not owed anything.  \n\n>And I know that you are assuming you have this knowledge to explain your answer, but it raises a red flag.\n\nI'm not assuming anything\n\n>Any reason why a woman doesn\u2019t want to have sex is valid.\n\nI never said otherwise and made it clear that no one owes anyone anything...why are you still pushing this point when I've never said anything like that? It's disingenuous and in bad faith. \n\n>And she doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation or need to defend her past relationship decisions about sex.\n\nOnce again I explicitly said I'm not owed anything over and over again...", ">you are saying that if she doesn\u2019t treat you the same as she treated other men\n\nIf I'm being held to a different standard than previous partners I'm gonna question why same as anyone else.

That said the more common version is a casual date and then sex and then they bail after.\n\nMost dudes who do this stuff usually won't be that patient and will stop trying after the 3rd or even 4th date but some are persistent unfortunately. Some might even just be immature emotionally and think they're ready for a relationship and then realise they're not when they should realistically still be in the getting to know you stage\" but ask to be together officially instead. This one is fairly common with people in their teens or even early 20s.\n\nI am similar, I don't need the connection to have sex but I won't without it because it's special to me. The specific situation op described is the least common of the types of situations where a guy bails after sex when saying they want commitment down the line but in reality it does happen some times.", "1. I just explained why. It's nothing to do with them being less attractive (can even be the opposite), it's all about the stakes. Like you are going to be more cautious approving a high level enemy in a video game than you will a low level one. Guy you don't like doesn't call after sex, who cares, he was just a night of fun. Guy you really like doesn't call after sex, now that hurts. So you play it safe and wait a little longer. \n\nPlus theres the idea that a guy will take you more seriously if you make him wait. That's not really something I personally buy into, but it is a consistent messaging we receive from the moment we first learn about sex, so it's something a lot of women are conscious of.\n\n2. Can be lots of things. Like previously she didnt have time for a relationship so wasn't seeking one out, but now is. Or she just tried casual sex and then decided it was ultimately unfulfilling so doesn't do it anymore.\n\n3. You aren't being punished, she's protecting herself. You thinking it's because your not attractive enough is just your own insecurities. If she didn't find you attractive, why would she be in a relationship with you? Assuming after a few months you are in a relationship, if not then yeah, either gender I generally think that means that aren't that into you.\n\nYou are of course free to not date someone if you don't want to wait ages to have sex, I'm just trying to give you an insight as to why women do this. Because you are thinking about it as a man, where the only reason you wouldn't get into a relationship with someone is because you aren't interested enough (though even then I don't think it's that black and white, if I were in that situation I'd first be thinking about whether jumping into a relationship went badly for him in the past, and that's why he might be being more cautious). That's not how it works with women and sex, sex is complicated for us and involves a host of social and emotional factors that can influence when we feel comfortable doing it. If shes giving you consistent attention, shes attracted to you.", "\u201cIf I\u2019m being held to a different standard\u2026\u201d \n\nActually, she may have grown and learned from previous relationships where she was hurt. Everything isn\u2019t always about you. Most people realized this as a teenager and began being able to think about things from the other person\u2019s perspective. And this is true for men, too. Your example of splitting the check\u2026 is a thing called projection. You are projecting your insecurities to defend yourself. Despite social media, etc, making it seem like a terrible thing, this is actually something all healthy humans do. But the insecurity is usually caused by some sort of trauma. So, you may want to work on that to heal and be able to have healthy relationships. This is what people mean when they say that you can\u2019t truly love others if you don\u2019t love yourself. \n\nYou deserve to be able to trust your partners. You shouldn\u2019t have to carry insecurities that they are secretly judging you or holding you to different standards. But you should allow them to attend to their current needs. If your projected man split the check with another partner it might be because he made more money at that time or had fewer financial obligations. And so when he asked her out, he told her that he\u2019d love to go out, but couldn\u2019t pay for her. And that started a new relationship habit. That\u2019s actually a good sign because she isn\u2019t trying to hold on to the same relationship expectations *and* he is willing to be vulnerable and tell you what\u2019s up financially. He\u2019s trusting you with personal information that he doesn\u2019t have to even disclose. She could just say \u2018no\u2019 (which is a complete sentence) to his offer of a date. Or vice versa. Being real with someone is a good thing.\n\nYou are so obviously insecure, that I haven\u2019t responded for a day to give you time to sleep on it. I mean, even my showing care and love for you and reminding you of your worth was attacked. Sweetie, what did they do to you? You\u2019re beautiful no matter what. Regardless of what I or anyone else says or does. No one can take that from you. I\u2019m sorry you carry so much trauma. Much love.", ">It's nothing to do with them being less attractive (can even be the opposite), it's all about the stakes.\n\nThe thing is I don't know if this is a \"plausible deniability\" type answer or if they genuinely mean it...not being able to confirm I'd lean towards the side of caution.\n\n>Plus theres the idea that a guy will take you more seriously if you make him wait.\n\nFirst thing is that this is false, men will dip after date 8 or date 1 after sex if all they wanted was that...\n\nSo there is some element to some sort of \"game playing\" here where sex is intentionally withheld in order to secure commitment? That's what I'm trying to avoid but there is no reasonable and genuine way for me to ascertain that piece of information so I proceed by assuming that they are. \n\n\n>Can be lots of things. Like previously she didnt have time for a relationship so wasn't seeking one out, but now is. Or she just tried casual sex and then decided it was ultimately unfulfilling so doesn't do it anymore.\n\nThats fine but that's independent of the timeframe in which sex is had...people can have relationships if sex is not intentionally withheld too.\n\n>You aren't being punished, she's protecting herself.\n\nI never said I was being punished, but it's safe to say that in some cases this is a game being played.  She can protect herself I never said she couldn't. It's just that due to the nature of how the dating market is set up today I have to proceed the way that I am as it's not in my best interest to wait as a man despite me personally preferring that method being demisexual myself...I'm going to do what's in my best interest same as women. \n\n\n>You thinking it's because your not attractive enough is just your own insecurities\n\nIt could be that or it could be me getting played, or she might genuinely be interested and wants to go slow as to not ruin things...whatever the case may be I don't want to risk getting played so I proceed accordingly. \n\n>If she didn't find you attractive, why would she be in a relationship with you?\n\nWell the data says that when seeking long term relationships women seek out other characteristics sometimes at the expense of attractiveness including but not limited to security and resources.  If given the option a woman will marry a 6/10 with a good career and who is financially stable and wants to commit to her long term and start a family over someone who is like a 9/10 and broke with no future prospects.  As someone who is educated, financially secure, has a good career, owns a home etc...I have to factor in the cited preferences that women make into my decision.  \n\n>You are of course free to not date someone if you don't want to wait ages to have sex, I'm just trying to give you an insight as to why women do this.\n\nI understand why they do it and as I said I lean demisexual so I would honestly prefer that set up it sounds great to me...but just the way the dating market is structured not only do I have no incentive to not wait it's arguably against my best interests to wait...I don't like it but I have to proceed with my best interest in mind when dating and just due to the way the dating market is structured if a woman intentionally withholds sex from me there is a decent chance I'm being played.", ">Getting to know women and dating women without having sex is not in your best interest?\n\nRisking being played/finessed is not in my best interest, that's what I was saying.  Women openly say they will intentionally withhold sex from a man they want commitment from as a means to secure said commitment.  \n\n>Like I said, y\u2019all did this to yourselves\n\nWomen control access to sex therefore they set the price of entry.  If all women said tomorrow \"no sex before marriage\" men will adapt and wait for marriage (used to be like that for some period of time), if women said no sex before a commited relationship men will adapt...etc... the problem then comes when women set the price of entry low for some men and then set it higher for others...most men will proceed accordingly and either not deal with them or stick around long enough to hit it and quit it.  Hookup culture was created by women as they control access to sex.  \n\n>It\u2019s wild and weird and probably based on shallow ideals because the only thing you can go off is looks at that poin\n\nMen have less standards than women so I'm not sure what the issue is, men do value looks and there is nothing wrong with that...the women I date want a whole laundry list of stuff like they expect me to be educated, have a good job, be tall, be financially secure, strong, confident, caring, loyal etc... and that's on me to become that...I'd be excited if all I had to do was focus on my looks and attitude it took me almost a decade to build a stable life...yes men unapologetically value looks and that's fine because our list is much shorter than women's.\n\n>how does it benefit men? Well\u2026 you are literally connecting with a woman you like.\n\nThat's fine, and like I said it's even preferable...the problem comes from the inconsistent standards.  You would feel some type of way if you found out your coworker was making more money than you for the same job right? Same thing here...I don't mind waiting the issue comes when I found out I'm the one that has to wait and not others.  \n\n>It\u2019s all a game both genders don\u2019t wanna get used or played, best bet is to just have open honest conversations about intentions and actually live like you believe them.\n\nYou are assuming we will get an honest answer from women when asked...there is no way to know so it's best to proceed with what's in my best interest same as women.", ">Actually, she may have grown and learned from previous relationships where she was hurt. Everything isn\u2019t always about you.\n\nThat's either a \"plausible deniability\" type answer and/or me being punished for what another man did.  Would it be fair for someone to have their phone checked occasionally because their previous partner cheated on them? Maybe they should heal first instead of taking out their previous relationship hurt on other men.  \n\n>is a thing called projection.\n\nI'm not projecting, my life is actually pretty good \n\n>You shouldn\u2019t have to carry insecurities that they are secretly judging you or holding you to different standards.\n\nI'm not insecure, arguably having a standard and having the confidence to enforce that boundary or standard is one of the most secure things someone can do...staying in a relationship for the sake of being in one despite being uncomfortable is the insecure thing to do right? And yes by definition that's them holding me to a different standard it's not me thinking they are...in this scenario they literally are.\n\n>If your projected man split the check with another partner\n\nThat was an example to compare situations, I'm doing just fine financially I pay for all my dates but only for women who meet my standards.  \n\n\n> And so when he asked her out, he told her that he\u2019d love to go out, but couldn\u2019t pay for her. And that started a new relationship habit\n\nThe data says that most women expect the man to pay ([source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244015613107#articleCitationDownloadContainer)) so that won't work out well for the dude.\n\n>You are so obviously insecure\n\nI actually have a pretty great life, and the last two women I dated I turned down for not meeting my standards and expectations not the other way around...I'm not insecure or whatever other names you want to call me I'm doing just fine thanks for your concern though.  \n\n>Sweetie, what did they do to you?\n\nActually most of the women I've dated were very nice and pleasant, since I have a good vetting process...no one \"hurt\" me", "I don't know how many more ways I can explain this. I've given you plenty of reasons, I'm not going to repeat them and do a deep dive into each one. Waiting to see if a guy will stick around before having sex with him is not using sex as leverage. Having had sex off the bat with other guys does not mean she has to keep that standard in all of her other relationships, so you don't feel insecure and question her interest in you. \n\nIt's really not that hard to understand, just practice some empathy and ask yourself why she might be waiting outside of how that makes you feel about yourself.

My job doesn't have to pay me as much as my coworkers but similarly I can look for a job that pays me more...same thing here...no one is forced to do anything they don't want to amd I'd never advocate for that.  \n\n>Because theres an infinite number of reasons\n\nRight but there is no realistic way for me to know the reason so it's in my best interest to proceed with what's in my best interest\n\nI understand why they do it, hell I tell my friends and family that are women to do the same thing (hold off on sex for men they want commitment from).  The thing is men and women have conflicting goals so the advice for a woman's best interest is different than the advice I'd give a man...for people that I care about I'm going to tell them to do what's in their best interest and similarly I'm going to do what's in my best interest and in this case what's in my best interest is to make sure a.)

This is something that I've seen multiple friends do, and its not working out all that well for them currently.\n\nI didn't personally freeze my eggs, but did seriously consider it for a while. I have contemplated a lot and ultimately reached the conclusion that I personally don't need to have biological children to fulfil my maternal ambitions. I would prefer to foster kids rather than have my own, I work in public health and I've seen too many children in the Child Protection system that I think I could really be a great Mum to. Hence my decision. \n\nPrior to reaching the decision about my own parental ambitions, I spent years focused on finding a guy who 'ticked the boxes', without realising that the guys I dated were lovely but for many reasons were never right for me. This was going on, whilst I was worried about future family plans and making short sighted decision as a result. Since I have come to my own conclusions about future parenthood, and ultimately 'dated myself' for long enough to realise that my box ticking approach was the route cause of my difficult relationship with dating and men in general. Now that I have given up on these preconceived/over idealised ideas, I have met the most amazing guy who ticks none of the prediscussed (and pointless) 'boxes' that I was indoctrinated by my (well meaning) parents to look for.\n\nI'm almost 36F and can say that as a result of the above over the past 4-6 years, I am now greatly enjoying dating and finding the right match, and by coming up with your own back up plan/strategy with regards to having children, you will find you can go back to enjoying the dating process and not worrying about fertility etc.", "I love being a dad but I\u2019m not really a relationship person.

Some guys don't like pets/cats and this will definitely be a dealbreaker for them.\n\nAs far as if it seems like a red flag in terms of a sign of a mental health issue, five cats in one apartment seems like a bit much, but if someone knows you and gets to know you better, and sees that it's more of a situation where you care about the wellbeing of the animals and you're not just collecting them compulsively, you're probably okay.", "If you are considering a nonexistent relationship partner in your personal choices now, before that partner is in your life\u2026..to me\u2026.THAT is a red flag about you. That smacks of insecurity and lack of confidence. (Sorry\u2026not trying to be hurtful here) \n\nDo you. Live your life. The right partner will love your pets and embrace their presence, your love for them, and importance in your life.  And if they don\u2019t, they likely aren\u2019t the person for you.  \n\nI\u2019m not suggesting you be callous and demanding with your potential partner about the pets in your life, but I know from experience that a relationship in which the partner does not value your love of animals, especially if they restrict having any or adding to the clan, you will end up giving up that whole side of your life and in the meantime lose a part of your self. (Yes, I was insecure and lacked confidence in relationships)\n\nHaving stated that, I couldn\u2019t agree more about the red flag of cat urine and full litter boxes. Or hair all over everything. I currently have three cats and it is no small job to keep up with caring for them while keeping my home clean and hair free. It\u2019s how I start and end each day. And then of course there is play and love time. A partner will need to understand that, and icing on the cake is if they love pets just as much as you. \n\nJust don\u2019t make your decisions now about some relationship that hasn\u2019t happened.", "Depends on the relationship. As I said in my comment, I've been with my girl for 5 years, I've got 4 cats and I take care of a feral when it shows up to eat and it has it's own heated cat house and heated bowls in the winter, I foster kittens when the animal shelters need fosters until they can find full time homes. My girl has 2 cats of her own and takes care of ferals ( i've got a 3 bedroom place, she's got a 3 bedroom place ) and we've talked about when the day comes what we''ll do. \n\nWe've already said we're going to end up having to buy a four to five bedroom house which is fine, we both have great credit and I run my own business, plus one of my cats is pretty old, so that will put us back down to 5 when that day comes. I know people who have a 3 bedroom home, with 4 cats, 2 dogs and 3 kids and you'd never know they have pets. It's all about how clean you keep the place. People come over all the time and always say they'd never know I have cats if it wasn't for the 2 6 foot cat trees( condos ) and cat toys in one of the spare rooms. I have air purifiriers, the place smells great at all times and is always clean. \n\nI guess it's really weird to me seeing some of these comments about \"more than 2 cats and the place would smell, your clothes would smell, etc\" makes me wonder what kind of friends these people have. Because nobody has ever mentioned it to me and like I said they're surprised or even forget I have cats until they see the toys. There was even a vet tech who posted earlier talking about all of her animals. I think people should really take into consideration it's about how you take care of your living quarters. I've seen people with 4 kids and no pets and the place smells like a rotten dairy farm and a sewer plant and from the outside the house looks like a beverly hills mansion. Kids, pets, etc doesn't matter what, who or how many. It's about how you take care of what/who you have. ( wasn't directing all of that towards you ) Just saying people can make it work with  what some many consider to be a huge amount of animals. But to be honest there's more homes with 6 + animals in it than people realize and with kids. Now if you can't take care of yourself, your home or the animals that's just a whole other ball game and that's just not right.", "Exactly, my mother is allergic to cats yet when she comes over to see me and spends the weekend her allergies never kick up with all of my cats around. It's all about how clean you keep your place, etc. I've seen her walk into places with one cat and have an allergy attack from hell, yet with the cats I have she has no problems whatsoever and at times forgets I even have any. I think people just like to make excuses if they're not cat fans. I mean I have friends who have only one dog, keep a clean house and it smells far worse then people who have 3 to 4 cats. Same with people who have kids and no pets. It's all about cleanliness.\n\nI also think that's great about your other half making it work with you and the cats and has taken a liking to them. I always enjoy hearing things like that when people come around. Far too often I read stories of soomeone giving up their pet of 5 to 8 years because of a new relationship and it makes me sick because the pet was there first.

You're giving her a place in your mind and heart she never earned.", "So this kind of thing used to happen to me fairly frequently.  For me, personally, the fix was to not have crushes anymore.  That's easier said than done, but in my case it had to do with a fear of rejection and building up a relationship in my head that never actually existed.\n\nI used to be a guy who had crushes but never acted on them.  The crushes would go on for a long time, I'd build entire fantasy relationships all in my own head and then one day she'd do something that destroyed that fantasy (like getting into a different relationship) and I'd be devastated as if she had broken up with me.\n\nThe reality is, what I was doing was super unhealthy for me and super unfair to them.  What I should have been doing was asking these women out, or if that was a non-option preventing the fantasy relationship from ever getting off the ground.\n\nIn dealing with the crushes forming, it didn't feel like something I actually had total control over.  But I do, I did, I just didn't want to face that reality.  It's within your sphere of control if you form a crush based on a fictional relationship or not.  I know it does not ring true to you, but it's the honest to gods truth of the matter. \n\nSo the key to getting over this situation is to never put yourself into this position in the first place. I know that's not a lot of help in your current situation, since you've already had this fantasy relationship going for a bit.  Now it's dashed and you feel hartbroken over something that was always fictional. \n\nNothing to do now other than treat it like a normal break up.  Something that helps me was knowing that the person I had a crush on was not actually her, it was my own invention of her.  The real her, we never had a real relationship.  The one who I was in love with was actually a creation of my own brain that looked like her and acted kind of like her but was more like her doppelganger, clone or person from another earth in the multi-verse.  The her who I knew in real life was not the person I had this mental relationship with, that girl was a fiction that my own brain had created. \n\nSo along that line of thinking.  The girl who you work with and have to see every day is not the one you fell in love with.

Allow yourself to feel sad or upset, but don't dwell on it. Try to distract yourself by doing things you enjoy, like reading a book, watching a movie, or spending time with friends and family.\n\nSet boundaries: If seeing your crush with their new partner is too painful for you, consider setting some boundaries. You could try to avoid being around them as much as possible or try to limit your interactions with them to professional matters only.\n\nFocus on the negatives: It can be easy to idealize someone you have a crush on, but try to focus on the negatives. Remember that they are not perfect and there may be things about them that you don't like.\n\nMeet new people: Try to meet new people and socialize outside of work. Join a club or take up a new hobby. Meeting new people can help you focus on other relationships and take your mind off your crush.\n\nPractice self-care: Take care of yourself physically and emotionally. Exercise, eat well, and get enough sleep. Take time to do things that make you feel good, like getting a massage or taking a relaxing bath.\n\nRemember that moving on takes time, so be patient with yourself.

These fantasy relationships are like an addiction in that regard, you think it's helping and you can't stop so you create these justifications.  In reality it's hurting you and the justifications are just that, justifications. \n\nI'm not smarter than you, just older.  It took me a long time to really figure out what I needed to do and even then I wasn't able to actually stop until I had a real relationship going on.

You can get to know her better. Talk with them both and acknowledge their relationship, or else she might have a hard time trusting you.\n\nSo you either sit and feel sorry for yourself that you have met this amazing woman, and let her make your life miserable. \n\nOr you can let this woman enrich your life, and let yourself enrich her life with your friendship.

I don\u2019t begrudge them for their happiness but I\u2019m at an age where my friends have less and less time for me as they get consumed with their relationships and building their own lives.

I\u2019m never bored but I feel as if I\u2019m always just distracting myself from the underlying sadness that always catches up to me as soon as I slow down.\n\nThe second type of advice I hear is to be proactive and take action.

I'm not a huge sports person, so I could be completely wrong, but it might be worth adding a new hobby.\n\nThis is anecdotal BUT my salsa instructor said one of the best things you can do to meet people is to take a dance class. He's seen multiple proposals and firstborns, further my boss' son met his finance through salsa so...I would politely suggest taking a dance class.

One can be married, or in a relationship and still feel lonely.  Was just posting earlier dating is a train wreck out there - especially online dating.  People\u2019s values have changed, it\u2019s more about self centered , attention seeking entitlement, Also with social media portraying perfection in every aspect of life.  Ghosting , cat fishing , kitten fishing , love bombing, bread-crumbing, unsolicited nude pics , stalking are just some of the facets people dating have to face.  While self improvement is always good, give yourself some credit in terms of dating. And you\u2019re still so young!!! Trust me! Enjoy life to the fullest", "Honestly, for 2 years I was absolutely miserable. I took myself out on solo dates, and did things alone, but seeing couples and families everywhere you go is so heartbreaking.\n\nI now have a partner and we go to all the places I used to go to alone and it's really nice. \n\nThe pain of loneliness can be very dangerous because it can lead you to adopt unhealthy coping mechanisms. All I can tell you is that throwing yourself in to hobbies and friend groups will help a bit. Keep yourself busy and use this time to work on yourself and make the most of your time alone, because now that I am in a relationship, I find it to be ... somewhat exhausting having to always think about another person.\n\nAlso, try to avoid soppy romance movies, that makes the feeling of loneliness even worse.\n\nYou will get through this and before you know it, you'll have a loving partner to share your life with.

Life can and will surprise you when you least expect it.\n\nAll the best, you're going to get through this.", "The advice of work on yourself is definitely cliche and repetitive but its also true. Focus on yourself and build all the other aspects of your life, figure out what you want out of life. The idea that you need someone to be happy has some merit but I think it\u2019s wrong, so many people in relationships are unhappy and settle for it because they fear being along, so many people in relationships wish they were you, single, able to focus on themselves. Dont take this time for granted, take risks, life is short and will come at you fast. Dont rush into a LTR or marriage because youre lonely. Youre a quarter way through your life, many people dont get married till theyre in their 30s and many more have been divorced and remarried after that. Being in a LTR may solve your problem of loneliness but it also comes with its own problems that you may end up not liking as well. Take it day by day and jusy enjoy yourself.", "It may be that you are currently in one of those \"in between\" stages of you & your friends life journeys.\n\nPermit me to explain...\n\nYour friends are getting serious about relationships and \"settling down\", so it's natural that they don't have so much time for you.\n\nGive things a little time to take their natural course.\n\nSooner or later they'll be having kids and such.  You'll have even less contact with them.\n\nBut after a little while, they'll be calling you up -- frequently, asking you to commiserate with them about their miserable lives -- what with being married and raising kids and all.\n\nYou will not understand their angst & concern and most likely, they'll be hitting you up to cover the bar tab (because, with spouses and kids, they cannot afford to contribute).  But you will not be lonely; just annoyed that they do nothing but complain about being married with children.\n\nYou will learn from them more than your ever wanted to know about kids with explosive diarrhea, projectile vomiting, school boards, and the wait times in the lines at Disney World.\n\nThey'll be asking if you can take them and their families out on your boat (because you are single and can afford a boat, while they are in a family way and are deep in debt because of diapers and tuition and having to buy Minivans and that sort of thing.)\n\nAnd you can think to yourself: \"By golly! I dodged a whole mess of bullets!\"\n\nCount your blessings!", "Well. Look you have some rather gloomy thoughts, and that is one thing that is bringing you down. These gloomy thoughts are unjustified. Don't compare yourself to your friends who are in a relationship, that is pointless.\n\nAlso, don't try to \"deal\" with loneliness. Embrace the idea that you want to be in a romantic relationship and then go full way into it. Meet women and act. I believe showing attraction to someone (without any clinginess) is one of the most powerful forces.\n\nDating and having a relationship has become overcomplicated. It should be simple", "Finding a partner will NOT solve any problems you might be facing. If you're trying to distract yourself from loneliness as you say, then you are facing yourself incorrectly. You might have a fulfilling life outside of these feelings of yours, but it seems like you're still holding the idea of a relationship on a pedestal, seeing it as an ideal that you *must* have above all else. That kind of thinking can never help a person.", "Friends , hobbies , lol passions. Also the current dating climate is heavily a have it your way kinda thing. sure it\u2019s not an al\u00e9as relationship ect but people are literally more open to fwb fuck buddied , sneaky links etc than a relationship and you can choose what works for you so it\u2019s pretty much a win win  in my book.\n\nI value alone time and spend it doing tuff I like loud in used to singleness so it\u2019s just kinda my autopilot", "Perspective.\n\nYou aren\u2019t lonely, you just get to do things your own way.

I can do things my way however I want, I don\u2019t have to worry about how my actions are going to affect someone else, I can go learn what I like and dislike, and it\u2019s like an endless opportunity to learn about yourself. \n\nI feel that if you can\u2019t hack being alone then the end of a  relationship is going to wreck you. You\u2019ll see it as back to being alone and you view it as the solution to your problem. A relationship is never a solution, only an addition. Your life should be well put together and you should be comfortable alone before you go off searching for a relationship. \n\nPut yourself in scenarios with intention, such as solo traveling, places where your hobbies are done in groups, and just remain open to approaching people and it will find you i\u2019m sure", "I\u2019m 36M and completely understand you. One thing you don\u2019t want to do is compare yourself to other people (and this goes for anything, not just romantic relationships). You might not actually know how happy that couple is or what they\u2019re going through at the moment.\n\nThat said, all of our emotions are normal and part of life. Nobody is happy every day; some days are more stressful than others. You are allowed to be sad and I\u2019ve had some days when I\u2019ve just needed to cry or spend time on my own thinking. Let yourself be sad and get it all out but move on after and continue working on your other goals. What\u2019s bad is when you let those emotions completely rule your life and they start interfering with other things (e.g. stop doing your hobbies, not going to work, etc.). If you feel you are getting to that point, something like therapy may be helpful for you.\n\nAlso, in regards to friends not having as much time, try to make new friends, too, especially ones that may have similar hobbies. I don\u2019t really think you can have too many friends! It may also be good to talk with your really close friends about how you feel. It\u2019s normal that as we get older, everyone will be caught up in their own lives but I know with my really close friends (i.e. my best friends) that if I really need them, they will be there for me. With these friends, too, no matter how long it\u2019s been, it\u2019s like no time has passed when we do get together!", "The problem is that life(society) says someone else will fulfill you.

We are not two halves\u2026 we are great wholes that can make a greater whole. There is a big difference to being lonely and being alone. Once you\u2019re comfortable with being alone(and abandoning the idea of loneliness)then there is no settling, there is no insecurities that need to be masked, internal voids that you hope someone else fills. Because the moment you do that \u2026 realize that the person you settle for is looking for the same thing.

You sound like you\u2019ve gotten sound advice \u2026 friendships do wane as you get older but filling them with new friendships is what I find works best \u2026 and that helped me because your relationship should have a foundational base of friendship. So approach every \u201cpotential\u201d with the idea that you can be friends above and before anything and if the attraction is there and if it\u2019s mutual then you\u2019ll be in a better place in the dating world.", "I'm 22 (nearly 23), single and not lonely.

I've literally had women tell me how guys they have talk to just wanted sex. I never pushed for sex and was honest.

I\u2019ve been single my entire life and though I have dated before, nothing substantial has ever come from it.\n\nI\u2019m 25 now, still young and fresh with a lot of life to live. I\u2019ve also used the majority of my early 20\u2019s to rediscover the person spent my teens repressing so personally and mentally, I do feel like I\u2019m in a good place. I like myself so much more than I used to and I feel like I\u2019ve been slowly moving into the person I want to become. But, even though I\u2019m healing and I think I\u2019m fkn great, because I\u2019ve never had a legitimate relationship with another person before, I\u2019ve begun to seriously contemplate that _maybe_ companionship and partnership may not be in the cards for me. The idea of finding someone, getting married and (maybe) starting a family becomes less and less realistic. When I share this with my friends, they\u2019re very quick to reassure me that there\u2019s someone out there for me and I don\u2019t doubt them. With 8 billion people on this Earth, there just HAS to be and I\u2019m reasonable enough to understand this. But, when you\u2019ve gone your entire life without that physical or romantic validation everyone else seems to have some sort of experience with, it\u2019s hard to fully picture your future with someone else choosing to be in it. \n\nSometimes I feel that stinging loneliness, that empty feeling when the holidays roll around or when I hear about my friends and coworkers moving into the next phases of their lives. Sometimes I regress and redownload those toxic, insecurity-inducing dating apps just to delete them a week later. To combat that loneliness, I\u2019ve been doing my best to invest in my friendships, my family and in myself (advice one). Even though that specific void of a romantic partnership will be difficult to fill, I feel like I also receive a similar feeling of emotional intimacy and fulfillment when engaging and connecting with my friends and people in general. I\u2019ve also spent a lot more time just taking myself out on \u201cdates\u201d and doing things I\u2019ve been waiting to do with other people. I\u2019m going on a Vegas vacation in 2 weeks and I have my first kpop concert in 2 months. \n\nI think the biggest advice I have is not to put your life on hold waiting for someone else. I think that one of the reasons why I\u2019ve felt so lonely and isolated is because there\u2019s this tremendous pressure to be with someone and because everyone is so worried about it, being on your own looks crazy and weird. A hard pill to swallow is that it\u2019s not. I have to remind myself that some of the loneliest people out there are married so partnership is not and should not be a metric of success or worth. Normalize finding comfort and joy in your own company and other relationships.

The ones who like what's popular,  go to clubs or use dating apps. \n\nI'm one of the younger people who grew up like the retirees, no internet,  no cable, I remember getting out first color TV set. \n\nI'm verbally liberal and will say completely horrible things, a very dark sense of humor, but I'm morally conservative and don't tolerate cheating in a committed relationship.  \n\nMy marriage has been with a person who is bipolar,  selfish, and will go after any vice over caring for her child, hence gaining full custody.

It's almost like our \"type\" that we feel a connection with is hard wired. \n\nI would like my son to feel like he has a family and just a crazy dad who enjoys playing with him like a child. I also fear that the pool of women who would build a future with a single dad is very very small.\n\nI have a good career, and a decent income (mid 100s) so I don't need some super woman, but someone with a responsible lifestyle and FICO would be nice. \n\nI think our current culture built around swiping right or left has us all jaded into thinking the perfect person is out there and we're all missing out on some potentially great connections. \n\nMy only advise for the OP is to listen to any advise since you never know what will ring true but don't try to make yourself into something you're not just to be in a relationship.  Trust your gut more, and if someone is worth it don't run away because something isn't perfect. \n\nEven though by long term partners have been nuts, I wouldn't trade the memories we share for anything in the world.

My advice is to make sure that you are emotionally ready for a relationship and to start feeling excited and hopeful about your future again.

I am on a journey of self discovery and personal development. I think that I am at a point where I need to be single and focus solely on myself rather than even think about a relationship. Yes, it does get lonely and it does suck at times, but for me, right now, this is what\u2019s best. I hope you can find peace in your own journey.", "To mind come a few things, they might sound clich\u00e9d but they work for me.\n\nMeeting someone and spending time with them should be enjoyable, but you should feel like you have a full life anyway. You hit that nail on the head.\n\nBut if you feel like you're just filling time, that's no good. There should be a line between self improvement and hobbies. That should be occupying your time, it's a battle. \n\nThen comes the dating, that should be a road of self improvement too. Bear in mind with the above my mindset when a date is you know just terrible my main aim is to cut that shit short and treat myself at a local bar or food place whatever to something great. This I never do and a great date.\n\nAnd yes a great date can mean being rejected. Just some people are such a breath of fresh air, that even they reject you, they're polite and well... it can be nice that's all. \n\nThe terrible dates, we'll they become stories and experiences and the growth sometimes is just handling rejection (even bad rejection) well and also learning a little more about people, things you don't want and things you didn't pick up on that in advance, told you your date might be a problem.\n\nFinally, I began having a relationship with myself, even talking to myself a bit when i was amused. I started enjoying my own company more and even went on vacation myself. It increased my confidence and made me more self reliant. I actually always enjoyed time to myself but I see myself differently now, like someone who looks out for me and thinks. Then the guy doing the driving. A bit like. This relationship isn't working, I pull the trigger even if I don't want to, because in my head I know it needs to end.\n\nOther that those things, time is finite. Doing and learning all the things I want to learn likely isn't possible. Even having a relationship eats into that, so if I was single, I look on the positive at the time. Sure maybe it's really obvious mental positivity. But even though I know that's why im doing it, it still works.", "For what it's worth, I often feel the same (31m). In a bad stretch, sometimes a few mins daily at bedtime. I try to just ignore these thoughts, focus on other things or distract myself, and basically do all the things you described. If you've ever had a decent relationship, and someone you enjoyed spending the night with, not even sex but just someone to share your bed with. Well, I imagine most people know what that's like after they've experienced it, and I crave that sometimes more than most other aspects of a relationship frankly. It's just more comfortable for me.\n\nAnyway, don't try too hard or think too much. Just try to put yourself in more situations to meet more potential girls, even if you only think about it as more friends. Ask your couple friends to set you up with any single girls they know. You never know where you might meet someone. At the same time you can be bold, and find more social situations to put yourself in. Strike up conversations with girls. I'm admittedly terrible at this, I've never successfully gotten a number or date this way, but many of my friends have. If you don't try, you can't succeed lol, but you never fail if you don't give up! You'll figure it out eventually, be patient, good luck!\n\nAlso, it has recently been suggested that I find more activity based or club based social things to do where I could have common interests with a girl. This would be contrast perhaps to a bar or other cold approach where you have no common interests. Common ground helps sooo much! I know this, but I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for and common ground with someone like I'm looking for.", "It\u2019s really really hard out there.  I\u2019m in a year long relationship now but he and I didn\u2019t meet into we were in our forties so I totally feel for you.\n\nWe cannot control honestly what other peoples choices are going to be. But we can control our own including who we invest in. You just need to meet one person.\n\nI really think to we have to look at how we are looking for too. A lot of guys I know want a really young girl but but all of them are ready for a relationship.  \n\nI know I had to take a look at my own attitudes as well.\n\nI think it helps to look at your triggers too.

Every relationship I\u2019ve been in is n the past 7-8 years has been long term, living together, etc. this has been the longest I\u2019ve been alone and it sucks. I\u2019ve take up new hobbies, really started pushing myself at the gym and hanging out with family. Sometimes I\u2019m okay with being alone though, there\u2019s no one to tell me to come home from fishing, I don\u2019t have to make any sacrifices and I don\u2019t argue with anyone. But most of the time I wish I had a great woman beside me. It gets worse at night when I\u2019m falling asleep alone, having been used to sleeping next to someone for so long. But I just take it in strides and know that live will find me when the time is right, it can not be forced. And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s much better to be single than in a bad relationship. \n\nI hope you can continue to improve your life in finding new hobbies, things you like or whatever. Use this time to get on tinder or bumble and go on dates. Find out what you really do and don\u2019t want in a woman and a relationship.

I like myself and I enjoy living alone. But none of this fills the gap. However, when Im engaged in my favorite hobbies the feeling of loneliness if completely gone. When Im in a relationship with a women, the loneliness is gone.

I was not looking for anyone, but I ran across a fantastic Australian fellow on FaceBook a couple years ago, and he just blew me away, so I am hooked.  He is a good bit younger than I am and has some issues, including a number of failed relationships with women.  At this point he is avoiding romantic entanglements, thinking he is better off just accepting singleness, but he admits to being lonely.  Stupidly, I do not see this as a roadblock, so I keep trying, hoping that one day he will wake up and decide that he cannot live without me.  In my darker moments, I doubt that anything will happen, so I am trying to be happy with what I have, instead of continuing to chase what I want.  I would love to visit him, to meet face to face, but he has yet to invite me.  I suspect that to avoid the possibility of more pain, he would prefer that I stay where I am.  If I am there, then he would have to make a decision that he is reluctant/afraid to make.  Very complicated.  People have told me to look for someone local, but I will not/cannot give up on him.  At this point we are talking on the phone generally for several hours per day and having a lot of fun.  We laugh, we cry, we have serious conversations, confide in each other, and respect/trust each other.

So, if you like hiking, go to a hiking meetup regularly and make connections there. Or if you like art, do a painting class every week, etc. \n\nI recently moved to CA from PA, and although I moved in with two friends from college. We graduated and moved in the middle of the pandemic with WFH jobs and were all feeling a bit lonely and bored even though we had each other. We just started feeling like we needed more. More friendships, more romantic interactions. Guys are a little scary for us, though, because they can be so grabby and sexually aggressive sometimes\ud83d\ude2d. So I think our approach to romance tends to be let's get to know each other and make sure we feel comfortable.\n\nSomeone told us that the key to making new friends as a post-colllege adult, especially if you've moved to a new city, is consistency. And I think that can also be true with dating, especially if you're looking for deeper connections. I had a lot of friends in college because I was going out and interacting with a large number of people consistently. While I've maintained many of those friendships, my access to them is more limited, which means I'm going out less, and that decreases my overall interactions with new people or potential partners. It's even lower if I'm having dinner at my engaged friends' house or watching 90-Day Fianc\u00e9 with my married friend. \n\nFor me, when I was surrounded by a ton of people within walking distance, all there for the same purpose, it was MUCH easier for me to meet and connect with different guys and go on dates. You go to club events where everyone at that event has that shared interest, and you just start connecting with people. But outside of college, I've only gone on two real dates. I was feeling a little down about it, like I'm gonna die a spinster lmfao. \n\nBut I started regularly going to hiking meetups in the area and some cute little local spots to hang out. I've started connecting with some of the other single people I've been meeting, and we go out together and do SINGLE PEOPLE things. Your friends are great, but sometimes the priorities and the spaces you spend time in change when you're engaged or even in a relationship versus when you're not. I think you might just need to go to more spaces where the crowd is more commonly single and hoping to mingle, but also, you already know before even speaking that you share a common passion or interest. These spaces are where I make new friends and also typically get hit on or find potential dates. And things have felt a lot less lonely since attending these events.", "You're only 24 accept that some things take time.

Especially learning how to interact.\n\nEven if I think specifically about the ways you said you worked on yourself, it can still apply.  Due to lack of dating, I've become more insecure.  I'm very secure in the sense that I'm okay with who I am, but when it comes to relationships I can't see how anyone would be attracted to me, value me, etc.  And I'm not really going to learn to be attracted to myself no matter how much time I spend alone because I'm attracted to guys.  I've internalized the concept of being a loner since it's all I've known.\n\nNot sure what coping mechanisms you learned while single, but I definitely have some really strong coping mechanisms for being alone and generally being independent.

Some people are set in their ways, while others would be happy to adapt to their partner's healthier lifestyle choices.

But I'd like to say just do your best to enjoy other things and keep your mind centered on things that help you feel good.  Dating is incredibly difficult and one of the most important parts of it, is how to feel good being single.  Because honestly if you can't do that you won't seem attractive to other people.  So we've had some really rough experiences and we have seen how easy it is to break someone's trust.  I think it's important to realize sometimes things don't work out and it's not always just us.  Imagine if your ex girlfriend was just honest she said you know I wasn't ready at that time and I need you would ask me before you decide to escalate things in the future, can you do that for me, and if you make that mistake again I will leave you.  Do we have a deal?  Imagine how different things would have been.  But I think what happened was she took it really hard and instead of expressing her frustration with you and trying to work it out, she left you.  Honestly the same thing happened to me.  You absolutely did something that was out of line but where the difference would have been made is how she handled the situation.  Nobody is going to be perfect.  There are times you might want to have sex and she is not ready.  That's why communication is so important.  Funny thing but I actually tried communicating that with my then partner and it completely threw her off.  So think of it this way it largely depends on the other person and how much they are willing to put up with and it sounds like perhaps we were with people who were going to be very fragile about things.  Nobody should be in a relationship where everybody does everything perfect and expects that.  Communication would have changed a lot as well as getting over mistakes which people really struggle to do these days.  So don't beat yourself up you are just finding out how complex things are and you've put yourself into difficult situations with people who haven't been as forgiving.

Surely they're holding out for a girl they like better correct?\nMen do like to pay for women they're actually interested in, especially when they can afford to and yes they can tell prior to the first date depending on their intentions and their interest in getting to know you. But when they're going on a date just to meet their weekly quota or because the girl they wanted to take out hasn't responded, attitudes like this will be on display. They'll be on high alert and in defense mode. In weeding out women who want free food you've also weeded out those like me who don't like relationships with a calculator always thirdwheeling. I like to treat my man and it's always either one or the other of us paying the whole thing, no splitting, no venmo, no keeping track etc. I like to make him his lunch to take for work and generally make his life a little easier, and I did not want to do that for a man who's transactional. I also do not want to be in a situation where the guy assumes I'm trying to use him for his money and I have to pass the test and prove my worth, it puts me off greatly. With you, the good will kicks in on second date right, but women can never tell if that's something they'll have to prove over weeks/months. If he's willing to spoil another but not me,it's just not something I would want to waste my time on. It makes me feel like he's on defense mode and I'm fighting an uphill battle when I've never done anything at all. Just like you said, the women who will be alright with splitting and cheap dates until they earn your goodwill probably don't have many options to choose from either.  A more affordable price range. Remember, it's tough when others are willing to do what you won't. The scales of women willing to pick the guy who does cheap dates compared to men willing to pay, they do not tip in your favour. If you can afford it and you like your date , make an impression. After all the bill comes at the end of the date regardless of the place you pick.

I'm part of the r/dogs sub, and the amount of posts I've seen where someone says \"Hey my good friend of 300 years came over and yelled at my dog what do In do\" and all the answers are like \"Unfriend him right now.\" Or \"You should let him know he is no longer welcome in your house,\" or \"Kill him and eat his flesh\"\n\nI mean when you ask for advice you (you in generally not you specifically) tend to only include negative things that you need advice on, and not the unrelated positives, so that could also attribute to it", "Reason 1:  Almost every request for advice is one person giving their version of events.   People tend to be VERY charitable towards their own actions and what they omit, versus how they describe the person who put them in the crisis that got them to post on Reddit about it.\n\nReason 2: The Audience is not a control group.  It's anyone who wants to chime in.   If that person is a bigot, or was abused, or is 14, or just wants to watch the world burn - there's no difference between them and someone whom genuinely wants to help.  \n\nReason 3: We (Including OP) Clicks on what they're interested in.

Although, that being said, I have a friend who always gave the same advice to her friends the moment any challenge came up (\u201cdump him, he\u2019s not worth the effort\u201d etc etc) but, the moment it was her facing a challenge in her relationship, and she received the same advice, it\u2019s suddenly different for her relative to all the others she\u2019d given advice to.\n\nAlmost as if relationships often just need a lil bit of work, as you\u2019ve suggested", "If the description doesn\u2019t mention toxic traits I always advise people to talk to their partner about their doubts and concerns cause for me that\u2019s how a functional relationship works.

Firstly is that many of the posters are young here, and it honestly just makes a lot of sense to cut and run while you still have time to look for another person. \n\nAnother reason is that the questions asked on this sub typically require somewhat drastic action. It seems like there's a large amount of advice that says \"just leave\" and that is kind of true, but the reality is that people wiht smaller problems that don't warrant as heavy of action typically also don't need redditors to tell them how to solve those issues. \n\nThat being said, advice almost ends up always come to two things.

When it's not reciprocated, then it's fair to leave but how people discern situations to make it look like it's fair for them to walk away is subjective now because people are more self sufficient and getting more selfish.", "Maybe there's an unspoken assumption that there were already multiple attempts at communicating and it keeps landing flat \n\nSo once they go to Reddit, it's either shallow advice or advice from people who have gone through therapy, and giving free therapy advice lol\n\nI would also factor in that advice like this\n\n>for the man she\u2019s dating, who\u2019s not communicating enough ever since he found a new job.

Then sit down and specifically request that he turns on his active listening skills to actually acknowledge that it's a serious relationship conversation that can make or break the relationship\n\nGoing out with friends? What's the real origin of the jealousy? Emotional regulation and navigational tactics are needed. Romantic emotional reassurance is needed.\n\nThe kind of advice people are seeking - is basically free therapy on how to effectively communicate\n\nThat's why", "Because most of the people here are lonely and have have not had a long term successful relationship.

We don't value community like we used to.We are pushed into an agenda that leads to misery because of a lack of truthful and long-lasting relationships : and the more you feel that void, the more you consume.

I feel bitchy for doing this, but it\u2019s just a preference I have and I don\u2019t know how to tell him that it\u2019s better if we stop talking to each other.\n\nEdit: it is his child. Because his ex had tagged him on a Father\u2019s Day post. I wasn\u2019t sure at first if his child was just his nephew or something, but that post fully confirmed it.\n\nEdit: I finally told him that we can\u2019t talk anymore for that reason. He still didn\u2019t say anything about it nor apologized about not mentioning a huge part of his life sooner. We both are looking for a relationship, nothing casual, so I think that\u2019s something he should\u2019ve brought up from the jump. All he said he that understands the fear of someone having children and if I change my mind, I have his number. I was thinking about trying with him at least because he seemed cool, but I lost some trust already with him hiding the fact because that\u2019s HUGE information. I have previously declined dating men that have children, but the thing is they would tell me in the first few conversations though so that\u2019s why I have no idea what to do since it\u2019s been over a month. I was developing a crush on him and was shocked when I found out myself, so idk how to respectfully tell him that we should stop seeing each other without him feeling upset or hurting his feelings.\nThanks everyone for the advice though\ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: I get that he might not see his child as much or has no custody over them, but he could\u2019ve mentioned that if it were true when I asked him about him being a parent so please don\u2019t blame me for not knowing or asking because I\u2019m pretty sure people with children are usually upfront about them being a parent \ud83d\ude10.

Interact for a bit, talk with them like any person would talk to someone else about their shared hobby (without being condescending or gatekeepy). Most importantly, you have the opportunity to prove you are a safe person to exist around (something hitting on a woman doesn\u2019t do) if there ever is anything that comes of your interactions. It\u2019s pretty rough out there for women trying not to get kidnapped, killed, raped, or all of the above.\n\nWorst case scenario you have a friend and might potentially meet their friends and you could be compatible with them. Also, a lot of women will trust a guy is safe more and generally be less on guard if he is friends with other women.\n\nI\u2019ll give it to you that a lot of advice given to men is often incomplete.

Basically how it goes is i meet a woman, we  talk, turns out we have a lot in common, its a nice conversation, boxes  are ticked whatever. I then have a crush on her for several days after. I  might ask her out, if its an option, and then i get rejected. Or she  goes and dates someone else because i think the things women like  socially are different from what they like romantically or sexually.  Having a good conversation and getting along with someone doesnt mean  attraction in that way. I also know i probably dont stand a chance in  the dating market, but another part of me hopes i do.\n\nNow  why this is a problem. It destroys my mood every time. I get high on  the energy of it, of being with whoever, and it consumes me for like  three or four days, then reality comes back, im sad about it for the  next week, then i avoid women to not have that happen again, then i end  up speaking to someone new and it happens all over again. Might be a  couple months, could be a could weeks who knows, not every woman does  this to me. Ive never been in a relationship before and im midway  through my 20s so like the excitement of it maybe happening finally is  high but then once reality comes crashing down that you know its  probably never going to happen it just kills my mood.

Don\u2019t listen to that. Women don\u2019t owe you a relationship just because you are nice or because you have things in common. Men complain about the friend zone and completely ignore the POV of the woman. They think they have a genuine friend but it turns out it\u2019s just a guy looming over them hoping to get a fuck. Just as often as guys claim to be friend zoned is another woman who was fuck zoned. Cut that shit out. If you believe in the friend zone then you definitely will remain single.\n\n2) Do listen to the other guy. Don\u2019t be a narcissist but also don\u2019t shit on yourself. Have confidence in yourself. They just weren\u2019t in a place or didn\u2019t feel a romantic connection. It can still be a great friendship. Not every platonic connection needs to grow into a romantic one. That mentality isn\u2019t the healthiest. It\u2019s good to have strong healthy friends with women. Also many women consider that a huge green flag because it means you respect them as more than just someone to fuck. \n\nNow to answer your question, remind yourself these women are people. Learn to recognize enjoying someone\u2019s company without wanting more. You make guy friends all the time right? I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to fuck them. While part of that, I\u2019m sure, is from not being attracted to men it\u2019s also because due to societal bias they are seen as full people who you can make long lasting bonds with. Men and women can be friends without anything more. \n\nIs it your fault for wanting more? No. Am I also judging you for how you feel? Also no. But when you hang out with women, just meet them as another guy. Unless it\u2019s through a dating app or some from where romantic growth is expected. But other than that, just hang out and be friends.  There\u2019s no cure for wanting more, and I don\u2019t blame you for it. You enjoy their company and you feel like the right fit so why wouldn\u2019t you want to date them, right? But use this as more an opportunity to find new friends. Friends with different perspectives than yours. They will widen your understanding, and if you really wanna bring it back to dating then they will help your chances. Not by just being a green flag that you can be friends with women, but who better to teach you how to attract and safe women then other women? \n\nYou got this buddy.", "As a society we put relationships on a pedestal. Love seems to be the highest goal.\n\nBut is it the highest goal? what are your goals aside from love and a relationship? \n\nI ask this because the women you fall quick and very hard for seem interchangeable? I don\u2019t know but if you can fall in love and out of love wirh a person within a month, it isn\u2019t love. Call it a crush or \u201cfancying someone\u201d as the Brits call it, it all comes down to the same thing, it\u2019s not healthy and rather annoying for you.\n\nHave you ever seen a therapist about it? It reminds me of my friend who has BPD. (Here we are with the armchair diagnosis, yes! Feel free to downvote me.) but it really does remind me of her. She meets a man, he\u2019s fantastic, she doesn\u2019t care about her own life at all anymore, she does the most for him, then he disappoints her and he is the worst. Over and over again. You might not have BPD but the traits do sound similar. Only a professional may diagnose you.\n\nI do think you can benefit from some help though. I hope you can overcome this. Good luck OP", "It's totally normal to catch feelings for people who are nice to you. Maybe not every single one... but at the end of the day, you have to make yourself a priority. I'm not talking about in the 'sigma grindset' way. Take care of yourself mentally. Go to therapy if you can. Get to know people before chasing that outcome. Women are just people. They're not a key that's going to unlock everything you've ever wanted. You're human, and you will *never* stop wanting. Once you get a girlfriend, it will be on to the next thing, so savor and cultivate your relationships with people, be yourself, take care of yourself mentally, and don't be afraid to keep asking. Rejection can be something you get better at. It's almost never personal. I know that's hard advice to implement, but I'm sure you can do it. Some girl will let you shower her in affection someday.", "I am gonna be a little bit hard on you here. We are men, so I hope this open your eyes. \n\n1. Read again through what you wrote. Question: is that what a winner or a LOSER would write? My guess is that you don't have your life in place, and that you are a second-class man. Which isn't bad, but you have to accept you haven't reached your potential yet in order to keep improving. \n\n2. Chasing is feminine-energy. I can garantee you, the day you have everything in place, women will chase you. Why are you falling in love and feeling bad so fast? My guess, your mental health isn't optimal. Perhaps you have low self-esteem. Fix this first. \n\n3. Find your purpose if you don't know it yet, and work hard. Believe me, the day you have build a nice salary, high position or a profitable business you will be automatically very picky about your female company. Now, everyone looks great. But the moment you become a man, your boundaries will define your relationships. Most women today think they are special and perfect. Reality is, that same as men, just a few are good and healthy company. Be happy most men and women are thinking about o.n.s. and are not improving on themselves, this means less competition. \n\n4. Get rejected more. Continue asking girl out, and continue with the rejection until you learn how to walk away and don't give a fuck. Dates are nice, you are in female company and learn what you want and what you don't in a long term partner. Remeber, if you are not dating for marriage, then you are dating for a heartbreak.\n\n5. Love is about choosing, not needing. You sound needy falling in love with everyone. Perhaps you don't have options. Girls hate this. Actually most people do. Yes, a good woman IS a prize, but so is a good man. Work hard to be a man that deserves a good woman. Both partners should be winning. Learn how to lead, and how to be in your masculine. Most girls enjoy staying in their feminine energy. \n\nGood luck bro. Sorry if I was hard. I just want the best for you. If you are not training, then you should. It helps for mental health.", "Okay, coming from a woman, it's weird when people catch feelings for you when you're just being nice. And when I say 'being nice' i mean catching feelings in a few days of being friendly, or because you helped another person. It's not annoying or a red flag. We just find it a bit weird how someone who we've met only a few times, and knows next to nothing about me would fall for me. \n\nYour case though, from what you've said, you catch feelings when you see that you have common interests. I don't really see how that's weird. It's actually pretty normal. Relationships are built on good conversations and from what I've seen, relationship between two people who have common interests last longer. Of the women don't reciprocate with your feelings after having good conversations, maybe they aren't as passionate about those interests as much as you think they are. They're just not your type. Don't give up hope! You'll surely find someone who appreciates you and your interests", "I think you're chasing the high of the dopamine rush when you first like someone and think this could go somewhere instead of just letting a connection develop naturally. \n\nYou should make it clear you are interested in going on a date within the first conversation of meeting someone you are interested in. That way you don't invest time and feelings into building up an imaginary scenario and relationship and then have it crashing down whenever they don't reciprocate your feelings.\n\nAlso you need to learn to separate romantic and platonic connections. \nMen and women love having good social interactions with people, that doesn't mean they want to date everyone they have a good interaction or conversation with.\nIf you always think someone wants you, just because you had a pleasant interaction, you are looking at the whole of human social interaction wrong. \n\nIt's not all about romance and you should stay open to meeting a few wonderful people who will be nothing more than friends.\n\nHowever, if you want to date someone, you need to think of it as: what am I looking for in a partner and what can I offer a partner. Then go out into the world with that and find your match. If you don't think anyone will want you, you'll latch onto any crumb of attention someone throws your way and become dependant on that and get attached too easily. Most people run away from someone who gives of \"desperate/pick-me\"-energy.\n\nSo again, work on your selfesteem and what you like to call \"checklist\" not just from your point of view, as in \"what do I want\", but also from the \"what do I offer\" perspective, to establish what you bring to the table and feel more \"worthy\" when going out to find someone. When conversing with a woman, don't just establish how much she is your ideal, but also how much you are hers. \n\nIf she is into you, she will give you hints and openings, if not, the conversation will go into neutral or friendship territory. If the former happens, tell her you'd like to take her out on a date and get to know her better if she's interested. If the latter happens, bow out gracefully, thanking her for the good conversation and wish her a pleasant rest of her day, or be okay with being just a friend if that's the other option.\n\nNow, not getting emotionally attached involves not putting someone on a pedestal and refraining from letting your mind go into la la land, imagining how a potential relationship between you two would look like. That's gonna take practice and you reminding yourself not to go there, whenever you do wander off into crush-fantasy territory. Instead, try to stay in the hear and now. Pay attention to what she said, what she did, how she reacted to you and what her bodylanguage was like. That way you notice when someone actually likes you or is just being nice.\n\nLastly, take it one day at a time. If you haven't talked to her for two days, don't spend those two days imagining things about her. If you want to see her again and she agreed, great prepare for it and then focus on other things, if she rejected you, let it go, she wasn't the woman for you. That's why it's important to establish where your interest for each other is at early on. That way you don't invest in the connection if it's not going anywhere and avoid disappointment later on.\n\nThese are some of my tips to you as a 27f.

Which is an interesting one that has a lot of good stories by the time i die. That would be the shortest way to explain it. Growing up i went to more funerals than wedding or births so i was just reminded of death constantly. I saw people i was friends with die young, i saw family who lived long lives of regret die. I dont want to go out with nothing but regret on my mind. I want to live a fulfilled life where i was able to do anything i wanted to do. Whats funny is i usually achieve the goals i set my mind to if depression doesnt get in the way, which is why weight gain and dating is the two things that my mind focuses on the most and i complain about the most because those are two things ive never been able to accomplish in my entire life. And what sucks is i see clear paths to how to do it i just cant bring myself to doing it. Theres something stopping me every time. \n\n>I ask this because the women you fall quick and very hard for seem interchangeable? I don\u2019t know but if you can fall in love and out of love with a person within a month, it isn\u2019t love\n\nYeah i know. Its kinda silly when i think about it. Like i barely know the person but they gave me the attention so now my brain is like infatuated with them. Im thinking about them off and on all the time tell reality breaks and i get hit with a depressive episode. Sometimes its less than a month too, like a week. Maybe its longer than a month if that person keeps giving me attention. \n\n>Have you ever seen a therapist about it? It reminds me of my friend who has BPD.

I avoid my friends in the really bad episodes since i know if i dont i will blow up at them and say things i dont mean to people who dont deserve it. I should get it checked out since uncontrolled BPD would explain why i am probably a walking redflag and hell to date.", "I would up writing you a gigantic comment that I had to cut into two comments. And I got a bit off topic in places but I think there's good advice in it. \n\nIt's probably coming across as if you're playing games. Or as your ex said hot and cold. Showing disinterest is not the move in my opinion. What you don't want to do is send her a million texts, or really long ones, or tell her a bunch of crap you normally would only tell close friends after a few drinks. \n\nThis random person online that you're talking to is not your free therapy. And many guys treat their girlfriends like this as well and it's really not right. Of course sharing is important but she's not there to fix all your mental shit. \n\nThat's your responsibility and is something that makes you a good man. Whether it's therapy, meditating, getting better sleep, doing more fun activities, going outside more and getting sun. The better my mental my health the better I do with women. I'd say it's the strongest correlation for me. \n\nBut back to the topic. Eagerness is a hard thing to regulate properly. In my head I'm thinking \"you're really hot, and you seem super cool, I'm extremely excited to go out with you. And lots of thoughts about sex\". Obviously can't say that.\n\nPeople do absolutely love to feel wanted though. So how does this work in practice? Do cool things in your life so you're not just sitting waiting for her to text. This is good life advice in general but it's also good for dating. If you do interesting things then you have something to talk about. Maybe they want to do it with you but often not. \n\nI tell women I play a lot of Pok\u00e9mon go, and that's some seriously nerdy stuff, way nerdier than the main series pokemon games in my opinion which I also like. But women find it wholesome that I go out for walks playing and meet random people in parks sometimes so we can catch pokemon. They also think it's cute that I play a lot of Pok\u00e9mon with my grandma's dog since we're good pals. I certainly don't play it because of dating but it shows I like doing things. And I have plenty of other interests as well. \n\nIf you don't have anything interesting/unusual in your life to talk about you need figure out some things to do. This is for yourself as well as for dating. \n\nBeing an f1 driver is very cool so if you have the ability to do that it'd be my first pick. But since there's only 20 drivers in the world you should probably pick something else. And I imagine if you built incredibly intricate macaroni castles that were legitimately cool you'd find some women that would find it endearing. At least assuming you weren't spending too much time doing it and you weren't too obbsesed. Because I'll be honest it's a pretty stupid hobby. But that's not the point. \n\nI started talking with a woman and she mentioned something about magic on her profile. Magicians generally get shit on from a dating perspective, and usually for good reason. But I opened with the fact that I went to magic camp for a long time. \n\nShe thought it was funny and I'm fairly sure she'd been joking about magicians the whole time and was teasing me. But I don't take myself too seriously and can see the humor in most things. And we've had a few really good conversations plus we have a date tomorrow. \n\nAnd a lot of this may depend on what she's looking for. This woman has a boyfriend and is ethically non monagamous, looking for some fun. A woman looking for a serious relationship will also think more about how stable you are both mentally and financially. You definitely do not need to be rich but being completely broke isn't great. \n\nAlthough at your age you'd likely still be able to do fine. I was often broke in my 20s because I worked contract jobs that I'd quit and then travel 4-5 months a year. But I had enough money and had the skills for well paying jobs if I chose so I didn't come across as lazy.\n\nI'm a bit off topic again but women tend to want you to have an interesting life outside of them. Otherwise you'll probably annoy them by always being underfoot or super clingy or just boring. \n\nAnd if you're busy doing things there's a real reason you're not going overboard texting her. As opposed to specifically trying to wait a certain amount of time to text. You can wait some time before texting her if that how's the conversation is flowing but in general I am quite responsive when I'm not busy but when I am I'm less responsive.\n\n And if you're really in your head about this and need something more concrete try to somewhat match how quickly she responds to you but you can cut that down by maybe half or even more. You're essentially just trying to avoid a scenario where she's texting every 3 hours and you're responding within 5 minutes every time. \n\nDon't be sitting there watching your phone waiting for her to text and then immediately respond. You should be working or doing something fun instead of waiting But if you're having a text conversation and it's back and forth where you're getting immediate responses that's great and you shouldn't try to slow the conversation down just let it drift off naturally.\n\nWhen you match on a dating app you should send your first message quickly. 20-30 minutes is probably good. Even right way is fine. Try not to let it go over two hours. Makes it seem like you're not interested. \n\nIf you're the one who swiped on the match you want to be quicker with the first message because you clearly saw that you matched. If she swiped on you you get more leeway because you were likely busy and aren't looking at your phone. But every day you wait to message lowers the chances a lot that she'll respond. Even like 8 hours lowers the chances. \n\nTry to ask her stuff about her interests from her bio or from her pictures. If the profile is really plain don't worry much about your message and just send anything out. \n\nShe's likely used to getting either really boring or offensive first messages because no one has any idea what's she's interested in. On these profiles I've been asking people about their favorite breakfast food which is something I like. Honestly it's not the greatest opener. I used to ask about people's favorite type of dog but that seemed worse. I should probably think of something more interesting but haven't. \n\nThe point is that you don't want to take forever deciding what message to send her because you can't think of anything. And then potentially not messaging at all. \n\nMake it something that you like that she'll probably have an opinion on. If she simply responds \"no\" I often don't bother keeping the conversation going because I don't need to have conversations that feel like pulling teeth. \n\nBut you can keep trying with different more interesting things to see if you'll get a more interesting response. If she likes your profile enough she will respond to anything except maybe \"hey\" or something cheesy or offensive. Although it's perfectly normal for most matches to ignore your message. Best to not get invested in how awesome you think someone is until you've met.", "There's no art and you definitely don't need to play games or change who you are. \n\nIt's your mindset. \n\nA few examples: \n\n>I also know i probably dont stand a chance in the dating market\n\n>It destroys my mood every time\n\n>it consumes me for like three or four days,\n\n>im sad about it for the next week\n\n>i avoid women to not have that happen again,\n\n>the excitement of it maybe happening finally is high but then once reality comes crashing down that you know its probably never going to happen it just kills my mood\n\nWhat I'm seeing is, first of all, you don't think of yourself as someone who women are attracted to or want relationships with. How you see yourself directly affects the way you show up in the world and how other people see you. Thinking of yourself differently will make other people see you differently. This takes practice, of course, but can absolutely be done. \n\nYou also seem to be getting attached to the outcome, which makes rejection feel a lot worse. It's great to date with the goal of a relationship, but you can do this without *needing* any specific person to be the love of your life. \n\nDating is just about gathering information to see if that person will fit into the relationship you want to create. Sometimes, it takes a lot of dates to find that person, which means you have to reject some people and get rejected. It's just making space for the people who are meant to be in your life, and it's totally not a problem. \n\nBut instead, you're making it mean that you don't stand a chance in the dating market and that you're never going to get to the relationship part. Of COURSE that's going to feel devastating!\n\nYou're also making your emotions a bad thing. So what if you\u2019re upset for a few days? You were hoping for a different result, so it's normal to feel disappointed. When you resist that disappointment or make it wrong, it tends to feel a lot heavier. Let yourself feel sad, and then let yourself move on. \n\nIf you can reframe the way you're thinking about yourself, dating, and rejection, it's going to change the way you feel, how you show up, and the results you create.", "Thank you for your comment! Yes, chasing a relationship is consider feminine energy. I am not saying men can't do it, and I understand the misunderstanding.\n\nWhen a man chases a relationship and wants to \"close the deal\", he turns to its feminine energy. This normally (unless the level of attraction is high) results in women having to turn to their masculine, which *most* woman do not like, but must do in this type of scenarios as it is forced on them. \n\nA relationship is something you choose. Women will try to have a relationship when a man have owned their respect, as women must be careful with who they choose (after all they need a man to take care of her and her baby in times of need). My recommendation for this guy is to work on himself, since this will make other women respect him, take him seriously and wanting to commit. He must become the best version of himself to attract good women, but he must not chase them. \n\nA man needs to learn when to walk away. And if a woman is not interested, he should respect it and stop pursuing *immediately*. \n\nA lot of people do not understand why relationship don't work, and some times all they need is knowledge in masculine and feminine energy. All types of relationships have this, even the ones of the LGTBQ+ community. \n\nI hope you don't categorize this as \"misogynistic\", when in reality this is the way we operate as humans. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask, and don't take this as a personal attack when talking about women in general. I am well aware there are many exceptions and individuality always come in the picture, but at the end of the day, exceptions don't make the rules.", "Moving on, you do need to be careful with compliments before you've met up. It's probably best to just avoid any about appearance unless it also has something to do with their personality. For example if they're wearing something that could be considered art you could compliment that. \n\nBut I wouldnt talk about how cool she is either. Just because she likes some cool things doesn't mean she doesn't suck irl. And she probably knows this because she's seen the same from men so it's a bit hollow and maybe weird to give a complement about how awesome they are. But saying you also like a movie or band is a mild compliment that is basically saying they have good taste in this which is good. And if you both have interesting things to say about this topic even better. \n\nAfter you've met you can give a quick, \"you look nice\". After you've seen each other naked compliments are always appreciated and very important. Don't go overboard though. \"You have amazing tits, I love sucking on them\" or \"you look incredibly sexy when you're riding me\". These are good complements. \n\nWhereas \"you're the sexiest women in the world. I've never seen anyone come close. Looking at other women makes me disgusted. When I sleep I dream about your perfect body laying in the surf as the waves lap against your ethereal pussy\". That's too much. \n\nHonestly that last line is pretty funny and you'd likely get a good laugh if you said it the right way but if you're nervous it'll be awkward. \n\nAnd if things are getting more serious but they don't give you compliments that's a good thing to bring up. Don't make her feel guilty about it, likely she didn't realize she wasn't doing it and will feel quite embarrassed if she's a decent person who likes you. Maybe something like \"do you mind pointing out things you like about our relationship or about me? It makes me feel good and it'll help me understand how to be a better boyfriend.\" \n\nIf she's a bit tighter about emotional things she might tease you about it. And in that case maybe don't push things too hard. But if you were trying to talk about something quite important to you and she completely ignores it then that's a red flag. \n\nYou can try talking to her about letting you in emotionally sometime later and if she admits that she's a bit closed off but needs some time you can give her as much time  as seems appropriate. If she blows that off completely I'd say have fun or leave but assume the relationship isn't really going to go anywhere. \n\nThis brings me to another point. For your own good you need to set boundaries. Boundaries can be about anything. Some are hard boundaries whereas some can be fudged occasionally but you need to live your life in a way that makes you happy. And that means doing it with this other person. Obviously this is about relationships not hookups.\n\nIf you always do anything that she wants it'll make you unhappy which she won't like in the long run so you'll both be unhappy. The whole point of dating is to make things better not worse. And certainly after like a month it doesn't matter how hot the woman is and how great the sex is. If she sucks as a person she'll drive you nuts. Some people are so scared of being alone they'd rather marry a person that they feel this way about. Personally seems like a poor choice. \n\nYou're younger than me, I'm mid thirties, and you'll  probably be dating women around your age. You'll likely find some women who get annoyed at you when you try to set boundaries. People tend to get a bit more understanding about these things as they get older I've found. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't stick to them.\n\nGood boundaries are having some time to hang out with your friends or play your favorite video game. Seeing your family. Bad boundaries are you never compromising on anything or doing things she likes. Try to find things you both like. If this is long term you will evolve together and even make new friends together.\n\nYou can't insist on never hanging out with her friends or never going to her favorite restaurant unless you have a damn good reason like your friend died in it. \n\nAlso if you like women you need to be good at giving oral sex. You can't call that a boundary and say you think it's icky. This is unfortunately at least somewhat common. I believe if you don't like to put your mouth on it you don't get to put your dick in it.\n\nThe fact that I love giving oral and am good at it has made my partners happy and that has helped me as well. I love sex and have a high sex drive so it's in my best interest to do a good job. That's kinda the point of a relationship. You both make each other happier than you'd be by yourselves. \n\nThere's always boomer jokes about women not liking sex but if the sex is good or even mediocre they like sex. Obviously not asexuals. And if you have serious problems in your relationship that's different as well. But if everything is good between you two and you're good at it women love sex as much as men, maybe even more.", "I don\u2019t know where to start, this is much worse than I could have imagined.\n\nFirst of all, yes, all of that was horrifyingly misogynistic- second, just because you don\u2019t intend ill will doesn\u2019t mean your ideas and words can\u2019t be misogynistic and/or straight up bullshit. \n\nI don\u2019t know who taught you about all this \u201cfeminine\u201d and \u201cmasculine\u201d energy crap, but I get the sense they probably believe that babies can\u2019t feel pain- because that is how out of touch this person is with how other people experience the world.\n\nThere\u2019s just so much to unpack, I truly do not have enough time- but here\u2019s some things to consider:\n\n- \u201cwomen will try to have a relationship with a man when a man earns her respect, as women must be careful who they choose (after all they need a man to take care of of *her* baby in times of need)\u201d this has to be the most clueless sexist bullshit I\u2019ve read in a long time. \n\nWomen need to be careful who they choose, not because they might need help taking care of baby (which by the way very telling of you to refer to the baby as her\u2019s *instead* \u201cyour potential baby\u201d) but because people in general have to careful not to get murdered or raped. \n\nIt gets even worse when you wrote \u201c after all they *need* a man to take care of *her* baby in times of need\u201d first of all, women are not baby making machines and second of all, do you not realize that women and have been able to take of themselves and children without man for all of existence? Have you never met a single mom? Do you not realize there are thousands of lesbian parents who do just fine without a man? \n\n- a man doesn\u2019t need to earn her respect, he should just be respectful. If my boyfriend didn\u2019t respect me, why the fuck would I date him? It has nothing to do with whether or not the man \u201cearns her respect\u201d, men (and all people) should just be respectful to everyone (even people they\u2019re not trying to sleep with). \n\n\n- \u201cwhen a man wants to \u201cclose the deal\u201d he turns into feminine energy.\u201d First of, no. Once again, you have conflated genuine emotional honesty with being feminine, because according to your toxic thinking emotional openness is inherently female. While women are taught it\u2019s okay to be more emotionally in tune with themselves, having an honest conversation about how you are feeling isn\u2019t feminine thing. That\u2019s some toxic masculinity you might wanna see a therapist about.\n\n\nI could keep going but I\u2019m at work and can\u2019t give more of my attention at the moment. Please understand I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a monster, just deeply ignorant. I took the time to write all of this not because I want you to be cancelled or something, but because I genuinely what you to understand how misogynistic your views of dating are. I think you should read, \u201cFor The Love of Men\u201d by Liz Plank, which is a guide that can help men understand how toxic masculinity works. Hope that helps!", "Many men are in your shoes and feel the same. And I'm not saying that to demean your feelings, but to make it known to you that's you're not struggling alone. I feel everything that you feel because I've been there, and I still am. Working out and busting my ass off working and studying are great distraction too. Also having great male friendships and nourishing them have been very rewarding lately, especially with men who are older than 25. Working out and running have literally saved me from the Hell in my head. And even when you do all of that you'll have bad days because it's unavoidable. Today is actually my 30s birthday, and I'm still single. I managed to be in one long-term relationship which ended when my ex-fiancee decided to fall for her coworker. Life will bunch and kick you whenever it gets to do so, and it's fine. Just keep on smiling and dodging whatever you can dodge. And when you fall just get back up and keep on moving because there's nothing else to do beside that.", "Thanks for the response. I appreciate taking the time to answer even when you are at work, and I completely understand if you don't answer my response as we will probably go in circles. Yet I would like to express myself. \n\n1. About the babies part. \n\nOf course there is more to consider. Men are significantly more dangerous than women. Choosing a partner is deeper than the example I made. Men are significantly stronger and more violent. \n\nI was making emphasis in the fact that women *have* a need to be more selective than men. Reality is that most men can fall in love with almost any beautiful women. Against most men, not all. Men don't normally understand the responsibility that having a baby means for a woman (specially young and inexperienced men).\n\nI also made emphasis in *her* baby as again men usually overlook the powerful love a woman has for her babies. I am by no means saying men do not experience love for their children. But I believe the connection between a mother and a child is deeper and beautiful.\n\nI never met my father, and I can tell you, my mom knew my father had his demons. Yes, women can, I will rise children by themselves, but this is not how it is supposed to be. When a woman is pregnant, she deserves to be taken care of and feel the love of a man who is gonna take care of her and their child. I don't see how wishing people to achieve a nuclear and healthy family is bad. Yes, there are a lot of different families, but nuclear ones are *ideal*. \n\n2. About earning respect. \n\nNow that you hopefully understand why I believe women are, and should be, more selective I think it is easy to understand this point. \n\nI am glad to hear your boyfriend is respectful to you. Yet, being respectful is a way to earn to earn respect from others. In my mind it was obvious that respect is associated with a long-term partner. \n\nI really don't think there's nothing else to add here. And of course a woman should earns a man respect as well. I just *assumed*, based on the post, that the guy was a good person and didn't have the need to add that.\n\n3. About the feminine energy of chasing. \n\nReality is that *many* men will settle down with any woman, specially needy ones. Chasing is seeing as feminine energy because it pushes the other partner to be in their masculine. \n\nIf you reject a man, and he chases you, believe me it will be creepy.\n\nIf a guy reaches to you all the time through messages, when he should be working or doing something with his life, it will be creepy for you. \n\nInexperienced men tend to chase away their relationships because they can't control their emotions. \n\nYes, it is ok to talk about your emotions, but all I am trying to say is that men should not bring up that talk until they are sure his partner wants that. I have dated multiple women in my life, and the best relationships have been with the ones I've waited for. When a woman tells me she is not interested, I always thanks her for the memories and the time we spent and walk away immediately. Not because I hate them, but because I know there's someone out there for me. I believe we all deserve to be happy.\n\n4. Conclusion and goodbye  \n\nI have read the book you mention a few months ago. A good book I would recommend is one called \"the way of the superior man\". It is really easy to read and talks about masculine and feminine energy. \n\nThanks for the talk and have a nice day at work. You have challenged my position and delivered some good arguments, but made some assumptions on my statements, which is fine. It is really hard to explain everything. I am also really happy to hear your boyfriend is a good guy. I really hope you don't see me as a bad person, I would consider myself a good person. I am really respectful, and even though I have been with a lot of women, I have never in my life disrespected a single one of them or played with their emotions. I am always loving and caring, but focused on my mission and growing \ud83d\ude0a.", "It's sad you see my posture as a \"lost case of ignorance\" when I have stated that I am open to conversation and I am happy when my ideas are challenged, as this is a good way to grow. You are welcome to point out which lines are misogynistic, as long as you want to. \n\nMy points on masculine- and feminine-energy doesn't mean both men and women do not possess both. A balance in these energies create a healthy relationship, where men should *ideally* possess more of the masculine, and women more of the feminine. Everyone is different, and men with *high* feminine energy can have a happy life with a woman of *high* masculine energy. \n\nI really don't see the misogyny in this. I see this type of behaviors in relationships all the time.\n\nI recommended the guy to work on himself. Yet you guys are really focused on the \"feminine-energy\" part about chasing. It is deeply confusing to me as I just wanted to share my knowledge with a guy in need. This has helped me a lot, and I was hoping this information could help the guy as well.

Had 3 relationships, 1 of them was with a girl I met on OD the other ones where with girls I met in real life. It's easier to get to know a person who is more or less part of your social circle since someone you know knows her and can give you infortmation about her personality. If you date someone over OD it's hard, there is this uncertainty about the person. Just keep living life and put OD as a very low priority then your good.", "I mean I\u2019m not great at cold approaching women either, it\u2019s quite tricky - which is why I try to lean in on my friends and try to put myself in a situation where I\u2019m meeting new people in group so I don\u2019t have to be \u2018on my game\u2019 all the time and can be more natural! \n\nMy advice, if you want it of course, would be to expand your social circle. Try to get drinks with your coworkers, go to any social event you are invited to and try to build some new friendships. Worst case scenario they don\u2019t lead to any romantic relationships but you have more friends to do stuff with. \n\nEven if this person won\u2019t be your best friend they might have a single friend or cousin you would have never met without that connection", "Lol thanks, hope your relationship continues to go with your guy! Yeah, dating apps never feel right, they feel fake to ne idk.

It's much easier for me to start the conversation, and get a positive reaction.", "Yes, sounds good! I feel about the same, but I don't have a group of friends like that right now. I am much more natural and fun in a group. I get nervous and can be a little awkward one on one, until I know someone more or just in a diff setting. Good idea, cool!

But I also happen to believe that before we find \"the one\" we need to have worked on ourselves and grown into the person we want/need to be for ourselves.  We need to figure out who we really are, what our boundaries are, what we are willing to put into a relationship, what we want in return.  \n\nOnce we figure all that out, then it's just a matter of trying until you find that person that you click with.

Meditation is also a great way to process your feelings and also regulate your nervous system. Those are my favorite ways, but you could also try EFT, breathwork, or progressive relaxation (you can find tutorials for any of these on youtube). \n\nBut since you specifically mentioned rejection, I also want to point out that your thoughts create your feelings, so the reason rejection hurts so much is the way you're thinking about it.

You can't do that if you're attached to the idea of that person being in your life - that's how you end up in unwanted casual situationships. \n\nNot being attached to the outcome is respecting your needs and feelings enough to walk away from situations that don't serve you.

Obviously, it doesn't happen that fast for everyone, but inner work and mindset make a HUGE difference.", "I don\u2019t think you necessarily can choose your thoughts ALL the time but the key to me is realizing that I\u2019m in pain and letting myself feel that in the moment but then knowing \u201cthis too shall pass\u201dit\u2019s completely normal to have these human reactions and it\u2019s part of your growth and human experience on this earth. The more you train (or \u201crewire\u201d) your brain in situations the easier it\u2019ll get to accept those future thoughts and let them go instead of constantly focusing on it and allowing it to rule your world. But just because you think of another thought, it doesn\u2019t mean your negative thought just disappeared, it\u2019ll most likely still be there in the back of your mind but the important thing is that you do not let it allow it to hold weight over you. This will always be hard at first but the more you try and do, the easier it will get. Your brain makes connections and habits are formed when a connection is repeated over and over. The rewiring can help decrease the weight of the reactions that you have formed habits when it comes to negative thoughts.  Some people don\u2019t realize they are wallowing in their own pool of sorrow when there\u2019s a way out for them but they are the only ones who can truly get themselves out. External people can always give you advice or words of wisdom and love but at the end of the day it is you choice to take action, to wallow in sorrow or realize that it was a heartbreaking experience you had to go through to grow and accept it as that without letting it spill into all aspects of your life and make you more miserable for longer than it needs to. The way out is replacing your thoughts. It doesn\u2019t mean those negative feelings or thoughts still won\u2019t exist, it still may pop in your head randomly but it\u2019s up to you to decide if you want to fuel that emotion with negative reactions. For many these negative feelings become  routine and their norm that they don\u2019t know anything else. Thats when these feelings can draw out and effect you over years. Either way it can be a slow process but you might as well try, there\u2019s really nothing you can lose from this. It\u2019s all growth! \n\nAlso, after a heart break you are still in control of your self and your emotions although you may think it\u2019s out of your control. Your emotions your thoughts are always ruled by you. Other people can effect you if you let them but find the strength from your own individuality and the confidence to stay strong. Sure take all the time you need and I understand not wanting to jump into relationships when heartbreak might follow, but you\u2019re never going to know if that relationship works out or not if you don\u2019t try. I honestly stopped looking and that\u2019s when someone popped out into my life I ended up marrying but my past heartbreaks made me realize how great of a person this was and how he truly was interested in a future together with me and wasn\u2019t empty promises. Those past heartbreaks hold no weight or bandwidth in me anymore but I do remember the miserable times I had to go through to get to where I am now and I never imagined to even be alive last 20.

If he still doesn't want a relationship but you still want to hang out then it's as simple as maintaining your boundaries accordingly, but it's better to know than to overinvest in someone too soon.", "IMO i feel like 3 months is WAY WAY more than enough time for anyone to decide if they want to be in a relationship together BUT, it also depends on how long those dates are, what you do and how well you connect. 12 dates that are 60-90 minutes long are not the same as 8 dates that are 3-6 hours long. I'm going to assume that each of these dates have gone well (obviously) and they have all been several hours each, though. You've been on 12 physical dates and I'm also assuming there has been regular or semi-regular contact through texts and/or phone calls as well. \n\nBy this point, that is plenty of time to figure out if you like the person enough to form something exclusive, or not. As a 35m, I know if I want to pursue a woman for something exclusive after 2 or 3 dates. \n\nAs for the vague answer he gave you... I wouldn't think *too* much into it. Chances are higher that he wants a relationship than just a 40 minute sex workout. The guys who just wants sex really are just the minority. I'm 35 and tbch, I want a relationship that ends in something long long term BUT, I'm also open to hookups and everything in between. However, because I'm not really \"pro-marriage\" and that I am not 100% sure if I want kids or not, I leave it open. It all depends on the woman and how much I like her, and how much she reciprocates my love.", "I wouldn\u2019t wait! Ask and if he doesn\u2019t give you the answer you\u2019re looking for it\u2019s probably time to reevaluate the relationship aka telling him that you want a serious relationship and you\u2019re going to have to move on.

Either way youre entitled to an answer.", "3 months is more than enough to know if you want to be in an exclusive relationship with someone.\nOr at least exclusively dating.\nYou have the right to know if he's casually dating you , so that you don't get your hopes up and make an informed decision. Whether is starting to date other people yourself, or dump him.\nIt's perfectly fair to know where the other person stands.", "Three months is definitely enough time for a guy to know if he wants exclusivity.  It's definitely not crazy for you to want to move things forward.  So waiting probably won't really change anything.\n\nBUT... be aware that exclusivity is becoming increasingly undesirable for guys.  The risk you run with \"the talk\" is that the guy goes, \"aw fuck, she wants a full-on relationship and she's gonna start pressing it.\" If he still isn't ready to commit to a relationship, \"the talk\" might be the end of what you have going on.\n\nAnd, as of two months ago, it doesn't sound like he's keen on going that direction.  Guys have grown wary and weary of things always having to progress to a next level.\n\nAnd any of the variant \"the talk\" questions will have the same effect:\n\nWhere is this going?\n\nWhat are we?\n\nAre we exclusive?\n\nCan we define this?\n\n\nAdditionally, if he doesn't have a semblance of how the sex life would be, he'd be extra reluctant to commit to exclusivity.", "I met this guy off Hinge and we\u2019ve been talking for 2 months and a half now, but we\u2019ve only met each other 2 times.

He just wanted to see each other as friends because I friendzoned him at the beginning, but on our 2nd meet up it felt like he put in so much effort to look nice, he paid for the food and we held hands etc and I was confused because we were friends.

Let's go through this post point by point: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Was it not clear that I wanted a date?\"\n\nFirst of all this question is obsolete, cause even if it wasn't, the girl should have behaved differently (more on that later). Second point is that this question is nothing but self-manipulation - it suggests that you did something wrong, and you clearly did not. So if I were you, I would not give any importance to that (and comparable) question(s).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Did I misread her actions as interest?\"\n\nNo, cause here is the deal: You meet her at a coffee shop and talk her up, so far so good. By then she could have already told you: \"Sorry, I am in a relationship and loyal to my man.\" First time she did not do the right thing here. Then you ask her out for ice cream - this is the 2nd time she could already have taken the step to make clear that she is in a relationship. Again, she did not but agreed to meet. So for the second time, she did not do the right thing. Then you guys meet up, she gets touchy and all, hugs you and what not. Third time she displays behaviour she should not display when being in a relationship. Especially as she said this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"\\[My relationship is\\] actually pretty serious.\"\n\nBullsh\\*t. If she would mean what she said, she would have shut you down the first instance you made a move. I get a really strong \"talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk\" type of vibe here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, all in all the picture is pretty clear: You got to know that specific type of woman who kind of wants the best of both worlds. That is: Having her relationship with all its benefits, but also the attention of other men. Whether that is for validation or whatever, I can't tell, but women like these are a no-go in my book. Especially as she also does not seem to mind meeting strangers in order to score free ice cream while her \"beloved\" boyfriend sits somewhere else, probably being completely clueless to what she is doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo end on a positive note: My props to you for doing the right thing. That is: Standing up and leaving her there. If I were you I would not even have reacted that friendly but told her straight to her face that I find it worrying at the least that she seemingly has no issue keeping \"her\" man on a leash while meeting others. Get me right: There is a lot of amazing, loyal and committed women out there in the world, but as it goes we have to deal with more and more women who think they're entitled to the behaviour you just told us off - and in my book, there is nothing wrong with telling a person doing absolutely disgusting things that he/she is doing absolutely disgusting things.  \n\n\n\\---  \n\n\nOne more thing on what others wrote about her \"testing\" you: Let's give her the benefit of the doubt here and assume there isn't a boyfriend - yeah, it is a common strategy for women to shut down men they don't find interesting by mentioning a boyfriend who actually does not exist. Still that would have happened the first time you asked her out; and it did not. If she goes on a date with you because she is actually interested in you (and not just free ice cream or validation), it makes no sense to mention a boyfriend - unless she is some kind of psychopath who thinks such statements would make her seem more interesting, kind of \"hard to get\" or so. Cause decent men would stay off girls in relationships in the first place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo yeah, TLDR: You really dodged a bullet there, man.

Many women feel the same pressure and stress that you're feeling right now. It's important to remember that everyone's journey is so different and that there is no \"right\" timeline for finding love and starting a family. Putting pressure on yourself to find someone within a certain timeframe can also be dangerous because it could be tempting to overlook someone's compatibility for the sake of \"moving along\". While it can be tempting, would you rather be with the wrong person for the sake of starting a family \"on time\" or would you rather wait for the \"right one\"?  \nOne thing that might help is to focus on building a life that you love regardless of your relationship status. Pursue your passions and hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and take care of yourself both mentally and physically. Not only will this make you happier and more fulfilled, but it will also make you a more attractive partner to potential suitors.  \nWhen it comes to finding love, try to stay positive and keep an open mind. Be open to meeting new people, and don't be too quick to dismiss someone who doesn't fit your ideal mold. The right person for you might be someone you never expected.  \nLastly, remember that age is just a number. Many women are able to start families well into their 30s and even 40s.

Eventually we needed to have a discussion about some small issues we were having but then kids got brought up and we ended it.\n\nHonestly, I wish I would have known he wanted them so bad, I would not have started the relationship and saved myself a break up and a premature move.\n\nYou should have told her yesterday...", "Given your status, I would suggest that you express this to women sooner (as soon as it becomes relevant to any sort of topic of having a future together) rather than later.\n\nThe more up front you are the better you'll reduce the non compatible partners instantly.\n\nObviously if she wants children, it's not going to work with you unless you'd be willing to adopt, and if that's not the case then you you'll likely not want anything to do with the woman long term anyway if she's steadfast on having children, and most who consciously say they want children are to some degree.. \n\n\nIt's not likely that someone who's on the fence, would feel so great about it, after the fact, say finding out 1 year later into a relationship.\n\nIn fact you could argue that person would probably feel lied to..\n\nSo in general, if it comes up even jokingly about having children, at any point, or even if it doesn't, you need to man up and own the fact that you chose to have a vasectomy, for whatever reason that was. It's just more beneficial to weed out the ones not OK with that upfront quite frankly..", "I broke up with my ex after about a year of dating. He didn't see a future with me and didn't want kids while I wanted both with him. He strung me along for months and in the end with a lot of probing finally said that truth. Things had to end with him and it was extremely painful for me. So I would advise you to tell her ASAP and end this relationship because you are incompatible.", "Think about it this way. If you didn't have the vasectomy and she decided to get pregnant without telling you - you would be saddled with children that you didn't want-  how would you feel? \n\nShe wants kids and you can't give her that. Most women don't want to have kids only w themselves- they want to have kids with a particular person. With the person that they love. Would you be okay with her having kids outside of your relationship?", "Dude... neither of you are going to change your mind,  let her go and find someone who also wants kids and you find someone who doesn't want them or doesn't care if they have kids or not. This is a pretty big difference to have in a relationship and it will ruin it down the line. Tell her asap, but I would recommend finding someone else.", "You should've told her \"I got a vasectomy, because I never want kids\", the first time she ever brought kids up. Also, off topic, but a 6 MONTH talking stage??? What on earth have ya'll been waiting for (unless its because of this issue) that the relationship hasn't progressed to the next level?? LMFAO", "I\u2019d say let her pregnancy test tell her\u2026lol\u2026j/k\u2026. If you haven\u2019t had a talk about relationships or growing together then it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nIf you do, you must tell her unless she makes you want to have kids.", "You\u2019re an adult. So you sit down with her and tell her that before the relationship goes further and gets more serious, you need to have a serious conversation that could effect the relationship and be a deal breaker. This isn\u2019t something to negotiate on. It\u2019s a fundamental difference in compatibility. Reiterate how you have decided you do not want children, ever, and will not be changing your mind. That you took the responsible, permanent steps to not risk it happening by mistake by getting sterilized (also make it know if you also do not want adopted children if that\u2019s the case). Let her know that you heard and understand that her feelings are the opposite, and if having kids is something she wants, you can\u2019t provide that. Be understanding that it may mean and end to the relationship\u2026.and that\u2019s OK. Having children is a HUGE decision and a life altering, permanent one too. \n\nThis is basically how I brought up the conversation of not wanting to have kids with my boyfriend less than 6 months into our relationship. It was actually in my dating profile too. We\u2019re both about mid 30s, and he had been married before and was step father to her kids, but no biological. I asked about if he thought he wanted kids. He wasn\u2019t totally on board with the idea of having them and was more indifferent. I told him that if he thought it was something he wanted, it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d be able to provide for him, and I understood if that wouldn\u2019t work for him. Gave him time to think on his own about things more seriously and then we had another conversation.", "The bigger thing is you both want very different things out of life. If she wants children and you dont then the conversation about what both of you hope to get out of this relationship needs to be had. Don\u2019t break hearts needlessly. You can\u2019t change something so fundamental about yourself or your partner", "Wow 22 years old is young for a vasectomy. Totally respect your decision though!  I got mine at 46 after my girlfriend got pregnant despite being very careful (she got an abortion).

Is she ok with adoption.\n\nAre you ok with a speed donor? Is she ok with it?\n\nDo you want to go through the surgery and pay the cost to reverse it? As others have said, it\u2019s not cheap and not totally effective.\n\nIf the answer is no:\n\nThen you may just not be a good match for her.\n\nThe longer you postpone telling her, the more difficult it will become and the more time you will waste, both hers and yours\n\nI also recommend that you disclose this as soon as possible in the future. When I meet a new potential partner I tell them almost immediately about my procedure. I\u2019ve listed it on my dating profile as well. I also had a photo of the procedure being done, for when women didn\u2019t believe me. A few have asked to see it.\n\nThe truth is there are many many women out there looking for child free relationships. I believe there is even a sub here called r/cf4cf \n\nAlways be honest and up front about this. Also, did you go through the process of getting your sperm tested following the procedure?", "This is something that needs to be said as soon as the relationship starts. Like \"hay, just so we're all clear, I don't want kids so I had a vasectomy\". That way they react how they'll react. If it's a deal breaker for them, you'll know and no ones time will get wasted.", "Dude. I say this as a proud member of /r/childfree and also an owner of a snipped pair of nads, you tell her you had a vasectomy **at the start of your relationship.** Given that you've already let 6 months go by, **tell her immediately.**\n\nHow would you feel if you hadn't had a vasectomy, and she baby-trapped you when you said you didn't want kids? You're doing the same thing to her and it's *disgusting*.\n\nThink about what your actions do to other people for once.  \n\n\nEDIT: And if you're looking how to bring it up, you bring it up like any other very serious point in a relationship: you ask her to sit down with you, you tell her the truth. Tell her you were worried about her answer on kids and that you plan on NEVER having them. Tell her you went so far to make sure you wouldn't have kids that you had a vasectomy. Tell her you are worried that she wants different things and that you're abusing her trust.\n\nShe might yell at you, scream at you, or otherwise lose her shit. I would at you, if I were her. But it's the mature, reasonable, selfless way to move forward here.", "Vasectomies can be reversed. The conversation is not whether you got one or not, it is that you don\u2019t want kids. If that\u2019s something you believe in - which you do, hence the operation - then you need to open up and stand your ground. \n\nThe beginning of the relationship is the best moment to be transparent about such an important topic.

Out of human decency, you should tell her, then it\u2019s in her court to decide if she is ok with that or not.", "If you care about her you will tell her asap and expect the relationship to end. Your relationship is destined for resentment in the future if you stay together. Give her the opportunity to start looking for a partner who does want to have children.", "Dude, you always tell someone who tells you they want kids, with immediately saying you don\u2019t if you don\u2019t.\n\nReason is kids, marriage, finances, and religion are core values that are considered NON-NEGOTIABLE because both people have set things they want in a relationship.\n\nYou don\u2019t stay with people who do want kids and marriage, but you don\u2019t.\n\nNo one will be happy because unless they give up their dreams for kids and marriage or you give into having kids and marriage, you two will not be compatible for the long haul. \n\nYou two are soooo incompatible it\u2019s not even a laughing matter.", "it would've been good to mention when she said she wanted kids since kids is something you can't compromise on in a relationship. so, if I were you, I'd just say something like, \"hey, I should've said this sooner, but you said you want kids and that's something we wouldn't be able to do together because I had a vasectomy and I don't want to have kids.\" maybe find a way to make it less blunt? either way, good luck!", "Saying \"I don't want kids\" when you actually can't have them, might technically not be a lie but it's manipulation.\n\nYou might be thinking \"I told her I don't want kids so if she's hoping to change my mind on that, that's on her\". In fact that hope of hers might be the only thing keeping this relationship together. And maybe you already know that, and maybe that's why you're keeping it vague and obscured, intentionally and consciously. I hope that's not the case because that would make you a doubly shitty person", "If she\u2019s trying for a real relationship then this dealbreaker should have been discussed 5 months ago.

Not taking his wish serious about not wanting children sounds very disrespectful towards his future goals. \n\nYou assume he might change his mind. What if he is very sure and has a good reason for the vasectomy? Like a genetic trait he does not wish upon his offspring? She then is wasting time for both.  For me assumptions are the mother of all F-ups. \n\nIt also takes away accountability, they are both adults (albeit young adults) and should have learned not to assume anything, especially in something as important as a relationship and future plans/goals like starting a family.\n\nI rather don't make assumptions. Those are lessons learned the hard way. \n\nIf she respects his wish for a future without children there is no need to disclose a vasectomy based on the assumption he might change his mind. Idle wishes based on assumptions are all on her."]}, {"title": "I (25M) am dating a 30F and I truly believe she lacks emotional maturity, every time I have an issue so does she (tit for tat), how do I communicate before I've had enough?", "body": "Every time something bothers me enough to where I'll bring it up to her to resolve it, it seems suddenly there's something I have been doing or had just done previously that is equally stressful to her.

You have to decide whether you want to put in the energy she's going to need from you in order to have a relationship with her.\n\nIf you decide that you want to see this through, what worked for us is me first realizing that she was a perfect product of her upbringing, and then her eventually realizing the same and learning new ways to behave on her own. \n\nFor me, I realized that her immaturity wasn't her brain being under-developed, but rather her family are extremely toxic and dysfunctional. Mine are too, so it was hard to recognize, but the internet helped me there. I asked her more about her childhood, and learned that she had been disassociating emotions for years. Her parents also don't know how to express, or process emotions at all. They criticized her endlessly, so she felt worthless and became extremely sensitive to even healthy shame. This was the key realization for me, and what allowed me to accept her immaturity. Treat her kindly despite her being disrespectful. Over several years I kept telling her about CPTSD, and how it affects people in the way that she suffers. One day, she came across some Patrick Teahan videos on Youtube (psychologist) which resonated with her. He did some roleplays on how toxic families would respond to different situations, and then how a healthy one would. Her mind was blown, and she inhaled it all, and then moved on to John Bradshaw's videos from the 80s about Family Systems. Those were just amazing...I can't believe he did that so long ago and we still don't have it in common understanding already.\n\nLong story short, my kindness after her emotional outbursts showed her I was committed to making our relationship work. To protect my own sanity, whenever it happened, I insisted she needed to see that she was being abusive when she stonewalled, or gaslit, or yelled, or assumed hostile intent when something was ambiguous. When she saw the same information from another place, it gained enough power in her mind to start realizing the behavior she learned from her family was indeed toxic, and harmful to her loved ones (me). Since then, she's been distancing herself from her still-immature family, and we've been talking about what our own healthy, functional family system should look like. She also did hypnotherapy, which has smoothed out the most painful stored emotions from her childhood, and I did it as well to address mine. \n\nIt would have been nice to learn all of this when we were in our mid-twenties, but the family systems we inherited were not supportive of that. It's pure fluke we figured it out ourselves, but man was it worth hanging on for. My wife is the smartest, sweetest, most fun person I know.

Some points to add. \n\nWhen I speak to friends and guys I advise now (I somehow became a coach as my friends were asking how I manage to attract some great women). Here are a few tips. Full disclaimer I started out unable to attract any sort of attention when I was younger and just said fuck it over a period of time. \n\n\n1. Get yourself out there\n\nYou won't be able to attract women if you aren't in an environment where there are women. Dating apps, meet-ups, bars, social events. Anywhere where you will have women around. \n\n2. Learn to simply say hi\n\nAs Gretzky said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. I still get rejected considerably but each interaction is an opportunity to find out about someone and make new friends. A few of the more longer term relationships I've had have been highly spontaneous.\n\n3. Work on your appearance\n\nImagine if someone came up to you dishevelled, unkempt and didn't smell good. Would you think of them positively or negatively as a first impression? It's the exact same for women. If you wear decent clothing and smell good you're already a long way into attraction. \n\n4. For longer term romance, experience will guide you. \n\nWhen I started out doing the above it took me a while to get comfortable and enjoy interactions I was having with women. Each experience is a learning point. It took time to become good at conversation, kissing, affection, sex. With each interaction you have your mind will naturally align to improve. You're only 21 so you have lots of time!\n\nI've got my blog in my profile so feel free to take a look and I'll be posting regularly about the various women I've met and what behaviours I learned/led me to dating them. \n\n5. Getting out of the friendzone\n\nGrowing up I knew all the hot girls in my school but never did one want to date me. That's because my fear of rejection led me to treat them like friends. If you treat someone like a friend they will become exactly that. What got me over this is to be honest with them (and myself) about how I felt. Telling a woman that you find her attractive will almost always be taken in a positive light if you react well to whatever she says. That's if you react in a way that shows you're confident about what you said and completely fine regardless of her reaction. Even if she responds negatively, you can say 'all good' and move on. I've never had a bad response when they realize I'm happy in myself regardless of whether they like me or not. \n\nI've got some of my past interactions and examples of how I ended up on dates, relationships and lessons learned in my blog which is in my profile. Feel free to have a look and I'll be posting about my previous romances and how they evolved on there. \n\nBest of luck and feel free to DM for more advice.", "Okay this might have been a post for the Lonely sub. But I read a lot of reasons/excuses for not being great with women. That\u2019s okay! Also, keep in mind, nobody expects you to be great with them, no pressure.\n\nThe thing is, I feel like if a girl likes you, it isn\u2019t hard to build a romantic relationship.

Now you just talk about women in general.\n\nI noticed whenever a woman was interested in me, she would let me know in some way I\u2019d understand. She would ask me out.

Software is unfortunately very male heavy but that doesn't mean you can't meet someone with similar interests. \n\nIt sounds like your problem here is actually getting in front of women (and maybe to some extent the initial phase of attraction). \n\n1. There are many tech meetups and other socials that have lots of women. \n\nGo to these with no expectations on yourself except making friends. When you add a layer of 'i'm here to meet someone' then it makes the event less fun. \n\nSpeed dating can be great for time purposes and you meet a lot of women. \n\n2. Dating apps\n\nAs shit as they can be, they are a sure fire way to get dates if you don't have the time. When I'm doing crazy months in hospital or the business I use these to meet women. Put up pics of you smiling, travelling, with animals and friends having a good time. No random headshots. When on the messaging always go light-hearted as a beginning, move the conversation onto WhatsApp/iMessage and then ask to meet up so you can actually explore each other in person.\n\nThe story I put up today on my website goes into one of these encounters from a dating app. \n\n3.

The only women that I've ever met that actually care that I know about spirituality, astrology, philosophy, etc are women in these internet communities. Those are things I usually keep to myself when it comes to real life dating. IRL they care more about the guy being sexy and fun, charming, a good dresser, etc. Then if they find out I'm \"spiritual\" it's like a nice little bonus. But first of all they have to see you as a guy they'd want to hook up with. They usually want relationships with the type of guy they'd want to hook up with. This is why a lot of guys struggle. Because they may be kind and attentive and the perfect guy in a relationship.

No one's saying you need to be rich, but you should have a reliable income at your age.\n\nBeing a stoner is fine, but smoking weed all day and meditating are not real hobbies or passions, and may be seen as solo activities rather than shared within a relationship.

I'm not talking about material value (although yes, money is important and you should not rely on anyone but yourself financially if you can help it), but what excitement, shared goals and dreams, and FUN do you bring to the relationship?

Sorry but if you\u2019re under 6ft, and don\u2019t know how to dress properly, you\u2019re gonna have a much harder time. 2) are you fun? Interesting? This doesn\u2019t mean blatantly stating you\u2019re a fun or interesting guy. Project that through your dating profile. Have pictures with friends, doing cool activities, etc. It makes her want to devote her time and also makes her feel a little more comfortable talking to you and wanting to be around you. Are you boring? Do you just talk and talk about boring subjects with no objective (which should be getting her on a date as soon as possible). \n\nI\u2019ll end on this note: If you are using online dating and you consider yourself an \u201caverage guy\u201d, you\u2019re most likely gonna have crap results.

Men are willing to date on par with or below their own perceived level or value as a human , women want to date men who are higher on this hierarchy , they will either match levels or more likely seek above , a man who is smarter , more stable , more intelligent , and more financially abundant . \nThis is due to nature and biology , they want a man who can take care of them and their children in the future . \n\nHaving said all that and keeping it still rather vague for the sake of briefness, I\u2019ll come back to the vibrational aspect . \nThere are a lot of \u201clow vibrational men\u201d out there . \nDue to the lack of \u201cgood men\u201d women have either lowered their standards for men and themselves, making them \u201clow vibrational women\u201d.\nOr , they\u2019ve gotten more picky and chosen to take on more of a masculine/independent role of their own because they see men as unworthy . \nThere are so many reasons this is true , but it all comes down to the fact that most people just aren\u2019t able to manage well in this society , we\u2019ve gotten weaker , we\u2019ve let our emotions , especially as men, take over our self discipline and drive . Porn has exacerbated the industry of only fans and paying to watch sex rather than have it,  and men having to do less to feel satisfied sexually (less reason to work hard for the approval of women)\nAnd women as well have as mentioned already, fallen into these lower grade roles and standards , or exactly the opposite , seek out only the top 30-20% of men . \nThe best women are hard to reach , and the lowest women are unattractive to men who are on the way upward in mentality and vibration . \n\nIt sounds to me bro like your on the upper end and moving towards higher vibrational frequencies of life , it\u2019s going to be hard to find a woman to match that , and like attracts like , your in a place where most people are not , and here is where there are less people available to match with on frequency. The higher you go in life materially, mentally, emotionally etc , the more you\u2019ll attract women that you also find attractive , if you decide to stay at the level your at , it will be a challenge to find a woman you are as attracted to who also is attracted to you as well . \n\nThis is the vaguest way to explain it without going for a year writing . \n\nBut I hope you understand what I\u2019m trying to relay in my response . \n\nUltimately , keep getting better and growing yourself , and you\u2019ll more and more begin to attract the right women . \nDon\u2019t worry about going out and trying to meet people just keep working on you and everything else should automatically follow . \n\nImagine a scale of 1-100%\n\nMost men are at 5-20 %.\nAverage men are more often leaning toward the 20%.\nAnything from 20% -60% is like middle class and is slightly above average on the low end, and more above average to rare, think men who own a home but aren\u2019t rich rich, wine moms who watch reality tv and like to party , on the low end . \n\nThan theirs the 60-80% \nPeople who take care of themselves , don\u2019t take in toxic or negative information, have a great amount of money and self worth , love to give , and intelligence, always growing ,learning, reflecting , reading etc. \nAnd of course the top tip end 80-100% which would just be the same idea but living the most clean emotionally mentally and physically . \nI would think of people like tony robbins and types like this who are constantly upping their game , they believe in the universe or a god usually, they always help people , they make pure bank, and they give a lot of money away too . They emotionally are well developed , in control of themselves , have ridiculous amounts of self discipline , and their lives revolve around serving the world and bettering themselves and those around them, tackling their issues and adapting themselves to be the best human they can for the world . \nThe difference between the middle average percent to the highest percentage is duration of time over long periods of maintained growth , discipline wealth etc. \nhigher rates of evolving oneself , doing more inner and outer work , and overall having more drive to do so for whatever reason . \n\nThis went on far longer than planned but , keep doing your thing bro. Keep growing , keep working on yourself , your in a weird middle ground where only so many people are , and nobody stays there long they either move up rapidly or down rapidly , keep moving up , and that weird middle ground will be in your past .\n\nEdit : (their-there)", "The comments here from other Redditors is so interesting.

I have been on both sides of this- from her point of view, she will likely end up feeling more hurt than if you were just upfront with her. When I was in her shoes, I felt as if I had been led on and I couldn't understand why he wasn't just honest and straightforward with me. From your perspective, I understand wanting to let her down gently and spare her feelings. But, rejection is always going to be a bit upsetting and hurtful, no matter how it's dished out. But, by trying to politely reject her, you're only dragging out the inevitable. It's pointless, no matter how nice your intentions are. You just need to be firm and straightforward with her. Something like \"I enjoy you as a friend, I think you're a great person. But, I don't see any romantic connection between us. I would like to continue our friendship, if you're interested. But, this relationship will not lead to anything romantic.\" On the BPD note, I cannot offer much advice.

Getting rejected hurts, but you know what is worse? Being strung along for years, crushing on someone who knows you like them when they do not feel the same way but they're too scared to hurt your feelings by being upfront about it, so they continue the friendship without clarifying their stance, maybe even continue the lighthearted flirting, feeding you bread crumbs of false hope. All the while you're hoping they'll finally be ready for you someday soon, and this continues until they get into a relationship, or you realize you're an idiot, and they're a coward. Trust me, that's worse.", "You need to be direct.\n\nNever continue a relationship (any personal relationship, be it romantic or platonic) out of guilt.

I think she interpreted it as him being coy or playing hard to get, because she would tell him she's ok being friends but then continue to randomly guilt him for not getting with her. And when she realized he wasn't going to change his mind (he and I started our relationship), she then proceeded to try to guilt him for \"keeping her on the back burner knowing he doesn't want to be with her\" or something , essentially accusing him of leading her on by remaining friends....

The reasons everyone has for their preferences can differ.

No man ever really picks a woman. They may think they do because it seems that men have some kind of upper hand because traditionally men do the asking. Men almost never ask for a date without a signal from the woman.  ( But if you\u2019re a guy and a total player you don\u2019t care about signals or long term relationships you just have a bunch of pick up techniques.) Most serious men will wait for a signal from the woman to see if she would be responsive to him asking, because nobody wants to be turned down! There are many many signals to let a man know subconsciously that a woman likes him ( I\u2019m heterosexual so this may work for other relationships too, idk) some polite signals from serious dateable women are subtle but powerful. They always make time for your conversation. They touch their own hair and body and fidget around someone they like. They make eye contact more than they do with a different person. And the one tell tale sign is that if a woman really likes a guy they will find an opportunity to touch them, a light tap on the wrist or they may pick a piece of lint off the jacket. Any man can\u2019t resist these subtle clues, they may not even know on a conscious level that a woman is even sending them, they just get a \u2018 feeling\u2019There are many more of these types of signals you can send, frankly if you really like the guy you are most likely already doing these but you might not notice either. but biologically women always do the picking.

However, I'm exhausted. This applies primarily to dating but I do also see how it impacts my friends, family, and work. \n\nI really struggle with this in dating, and I'm also now hyperaware and fixated on it. I overanalyse *everything*. Before the first date, I'm cool. (In a world of OLD) We'll likely have only spoken online, perhaps for a week or two, then we arrange a date. Fine. Light and breezy, and potentially a little emotionally unavailable and distant at this point. Then within a date or two when it looks like things are going to progress, BAM, feelings. All of them. A heightened sense of attachment to this person I've probably known less than a month, a desire for things to move forwards at a quicker pace (predominantly for a feeling of certainty, because if there's anything I hate about dating nowadays, my god, it's the uncertainty at the start), anxiety over, well, everything: Am I talking too much? Am I talking too little? Why aren't they answering right away? Do they feel the same? Do they want to see me again? Are they talking to anyone else? How long until they change their mind? I find myself going in circles in my head, asking the same questions, playing out different scenarios, and doubting everything. \n\nI think the two things I struggle most with in all of this is my lack of emotional permanence, and the subsequent constant need for reassurance. It's as if when someone isn't very actively showing/expressing interest, I doubt it was ever there at all. Several times I have told myself that the other person is just difficult to read, when, they're not, how they are/feel is obvious... at the time, when they're showing it... but then the second it stops, POOF, I can't comprehend that it was ever there. This then results in a split feeling of neediness and want for reassurance, but also a mental/emotional distancing preparing myself for the \"inevitable abandonment\".\n\nWhat's even more agonising about all of this is how self-aware I feel I am about it. There's nothing more infuriating and upsetting than watching your own self-destruct sequence initiate and being able to do nothing about it.\n\nUpdate: Thank you all so much for your replies.

This intensely triggered my abandonment trauma and I started crying hysterically. When this happened I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry for having an inappropriate reaction to what you said, this has nothing to do with you. My abandonment trauma was triggered\u201d\n\nTaking full responsibility for my trauma and being vulnerable and open about what was going on without making it his responsibility allowed for him to be supportive whenever I had reactions like that. Because it wasn\u2019t me blaming him or demanding more commitment. I was being open and letting him support me instead of making him my enemy which made us closer. Over time I got less and less triggered by stuff like that. \n\nNow 3 years into the relationship I don\u2019t experience those kinds of triggers at all anymore. \n\nSo my advice is to recognize the root of your anxious attachment style (for me it was childhood abandonment from parents) and then when you get triggered, take responsibility for your feelings ask for support.

Reminding myself that everything is okay unless I have a concrete reason to believe otherwise. Also, as unromantic as it is, I do talk to dating partners about simple preferences, but in a non intense way. For example an in-person conversation during a date night might involve, \"I'm really loving getting to know you! Is it okay if I check in with you during the day? For me, Im a big texter and would love to have at least a good night check in text, and maybe one phone call during the week\" (assuming we only meet up weekends). Then I can gauge their attitude. Because also, don't forget that some of this is just a preference in communication style. It's not all \"your fault\", sometimes there are people who just don't communicate on the same level that you want, and that's okay, you don't have to force yourself to settle. Obviously demanding constant reassurance would become problematic quickly, but there's huge room for compromise. \n\nOtherwise, if everything is good but I'm still obsessing, I have to just talk to friends, talk to family, and talk to myself. Remind myself it's okay to take things slow, focus on taking care of my body and my kids and my home, and stay busy. It's easy to let a new relationship become almost an addiction that takes away the ability to show up for oneself.", "I think I realized two days ago that I have an anxious preoccupied attachment style from one of those attachment style tests lmao. \n\nHowever, it was never a problem in any of my relationships? Whether I was dating a guy that was sensitive or not, they were usually emotionally intelligent. \n\nI've always been pretty clear about communicating my needs in a relationship. \n\nLike I need reassurance and consistency. And guys have never minded. \n\nWhen I got into arguments with my last ex we did this thing where we would end every fight with reassurance that everything is okay now. \n\nLike are you good? \nAre we good? \n\nI realized you make your own rules up in a relationship. And the right guy will never feel annoyed by you. Most guys want you to feel secure in your relationship. \n\nSo don't be awkward when it comes to communicating your needs. Be really specific. \n\nI told my partner that I needed good morning and good night texts consistently (even though he was doing this on his own, I just let him know that I want this to remain consistent). I even communicated that I like to talk throughout the day (again, even though he was already doing this, I communicated that I would like this also to remain consistent). \n\nFor whatever reason if the consistency was broken I would bring it up. Ask if he was mad at me or if everything was okay. And he always responded with a lot of love and a clear explanation. \n\nMy ex also used to do relationship check-ins with me to make sure that I was satisfied and happy. Which I genuinely really appreciated. After a while I got comfortable and I would initiate them too. \n\nDon't date a guy that finds you annoying. I've never come across a guy like that but I think my SIL has! And it hurt her feelings a lot because she was constantly overthinking. \n\nSo yah to recap: \n- communicate your needs CLEARLY \n- be very specific \n- bring things up the upset you / bother you instead of holding onto negative emotions, feelings and thoughts \nBecause if you don't bring it up, they will eventually harbour resentment. \n- make sure your needs are being met consistently\n- do relationship check-ins", "It sounds like you're going through a challenging time with your attachment style, and it's having a significant impact on your dating life and other relationships. It's great that you've recognized your attachment style and are working to understand and improve it.\r  \n\r  \nOne approach you might find helpful is to seek support from a therapist who specializes in attachment issues. A therapist can help you understand your attachment patterns, identify triggers and patterns in your relationships, and develop new ways of relating to others. They can also help you work through the anxiety and self-doubt that arise in your relationships.\r  \n\r  \nAnother helpful approach may be to practice mindfulness techniques to help you stay present and grounded in the moment. When you notice yourself getting caught up in anxiety or overthinking, take a deep breath and refocus your attention on the present moment. You might also try journaling your thoughts and feelings to help you gain clarity and perspective.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also important to practice self-compassion and kindness towards yourself as you work through these challenges. Change and growth can be difficult, and it's normal to struggle and make mistakes along the way. Remember to be patient with yourself and celebrate your progress, no matter how small it may seem.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, it's important to remember that relationships are inherently uncertain and that some level of discomfort and anxiety is normal. It's okay to feel uncertain and vulnerable at the beginning of a relationship, and it's important to take things at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Try to focus on building a connection with the other person without putting pressure on yourself or the relationship to progress at a certain pace."]}, {"title": "How do short term relationships work?", "body": "Do you just like agree to end things after 3 months or something?

For one, to see if we actually get along together in person. To see if the potential relationship is worth it. And to have a conversation about it then and there.\n\nFigured I'd ask \"Hey do you know a girl named [Ex's name]? No wonder your name sounded familiar. She and I used to date. She'd mention her roommates. We broke up last year. Are you cool with that?\"\n\nSomething along those lines.", "I suppose the details regarding the relationship, break up and post-breakup interactions would make a difference in the courtesy shown to an ex. \n\nFor one, my attempts at being amicable during and after the break up weren't really reciprocated. I told her we could try being friends, she said that was impossible. Only for her to later be upset and confused I didn't text her a month later. Along with other things, but in general wanting me to treat her like more than a friend when we were not.\n\nAnd when I tried establishing these boundaries, she'd get vocally upset and begin to berate me. I sacrificed my happiness and comfort far too often to keep her content when we were in a relationship. I don't particularly feel obligated to continue to do so, now that we're not together anymore.\n\nEspecially since this girl I met is actually quite fun to talk to and kinder than my ex. Will that be the case in person? I'm not sure, I'd like to believe so. But I need to give that opportunity an honest try before I put my ex's comfort above my own happiness again.\n\nFor what it's worth, if I do end up dating this girl I don't intend to spend much time, if at all at their place. I'll at least save us the awkwardness of that.", "See, now that would be perfectly reasonable if they didn't know each other or live in the same house.\n\nIf I'm gonna date her then I'm going to make sure we avoid any uncomfortable situations or confrontations by getting it out in the open as soon as reasonably possible.\n\nBesides, I'm not going to talk about my previous relationship beyond saying that it happened, it then ended.", "Believe me, my ex hates living with roommates as is. But you're right, given the chance you'd rather not deal with the potential drama. \n\nWhich is why I want to let her know. Give her the rundown on the situation. To give her the choice of trying this relationship out or to pass on it. And I wouldn't blame her if she thinks it's not worth it.", "Maybe not but you knowing and not being up front about it is problematic. It\u2019s a sign that you don\u2019t mind hiding (potentially) important information.  The only reason for you to hesitate telling her is to put your comfort ahead of hers.  Not a good way to start a relationship.", "This is a hot mess waiting to happen.  When his ex finds out and if she tells her about all of his issues and problems in their relationship.  It could cause significant issues currently.  \n\nMy attitude is simple find someone else. Someone who isn\u2019t connected with my past. \n\nIf you were married and you divorced your spouse.  Would you date exs brother?  Or dad?  Or best friend?  \n\nIt just makes life so complicated.  Unnecessarily.   For me I have a brutal work life.  I can\u2019t tolerate this shit in my home and personal life.", "Well, that's actually why I want to inform her. So that she can decide if she's okay with a potential relationship having full knowledge. Don't want to blindside her.", "If it\u2019s genuinely not a situation you want to put yourself in, why do you need her input about it??! \n\nIdc how much someone that lives with my ex wants to date me, or how \u201cgreat\u201d they are\u2026the reasons I\u2019ve mentioned are enough for me not to pursue it. There\u2019s nothing to talk about. So if you feel the same way then\u2026why is this even a thing? \n\nYou haven\u2019t even met this girl & talking about \u201cif she wants to make this relationship work\u201d? Sounds desperate asf. Which would also explain why you\u2019re even willing to date someone that lives with your ex in the first place - so I get it.", "Okay I think I see where we're disagreeing. I don't think it's that big of a deal. Just find it kinda crazy. Like \"what are the odds\" kinda crazy.\n\nBesides what I mentioned, it just seems like the polite thing to do. Like for example, would person A want to date person B if they knew person B didn't like cats or something? I'm just sharing something about myself that may or may not change her mind on seeing each other after our first date. Like my interests or job or whatever. Just information about me as a person.\n\nIs it desperate to think in terms of the potential relationship?  I'd say it's more like optimism. Because why not? Why not be hopeful that things will work out for the best?", "Maybe you\u2019re right\u2026\nI\u2019ve been studying attachment style recently & learned that when I see things that could turn out challenging in regards to relationships, I run. So maybe this is my insecurities talking and it will work out for the best for y\u2019all. \n\nIf you\u2019re not bothered by it then so be it, I guess.", "Hey I can empathize. When I learned about attachment styles it kinda fucked me up and made me revisit and reevaluate how my relationships went. Always worried that shit wouldn't work out or why I isolated myself from others despite wanting to be included.\n\nOddly enough, learning this information helps reassure me somehow that this girl I'm talking to is real. You know that phrase \"if things are too good to be true, they're probably not?\" Or something like that. Yeah, I think this girl is really cool, attractive and charming from what I've learned about and apparently she thinks the same. So of course, this is the caveat I have to deal with.\n\nAnd to be completely fair, your stance on this situation is totally reasonable. Don't doubt that for a second. Yeah I try to be optimistic but I'll admit, I'm kinda pushing it this time. Is it stupid and risky? Possibly!  But it's a risk I'm willing to take because I think it'll be worth it.\n\nHope you have a pleasant day or evening, whichever applies. Appreciate you taking the time to even comment on this post. And while learning about how we interact with others around us makes us uncomfortable at first, it definitely helps us manage our insecurities and anxieties better in the future.

I was even able to go on a few dates even though it just didn't lead anywhere, but I was able to get a platonic friendship out of one date so that's good. Anyway I didn't know how good I had it, in college you're surrounded by attractive and mostly single women who come from all over the place to study at the university and there's plenty of ways to get to know each other from class, events, dorm events, at the cafeteria, etc. And they seemed to be a bit more open to someone approaching them. Plus it was also alot easier to find something in common to talk about since at the very least we all attend the same school and are taking the same class. So I was able to get some dates at the time.\n\nBut outside college I'm honestly lost and have been lost for years now. There's like nowhere to really meet people. Seems like most of the women my age are in serious relationships, have children, or married.\n\nObviously you can't meet women at work, trying to hit on fellow employees or clients is totally unprofessional.

So not to generalize, but being a CS major myself, most IT guys grew up socially awkward and just dont fully grasp the concepts of dating. They also tend to suffer from the \"imposter syndrome\" at work, which radiates into every other part of their life. Basically they feel like they are tricking everyone into believing they are a better version than they really are. So I can totally see how a guy like this would try and overcompensate and try to essentially buy your love. Ive had to stop friends of mine from doing the exact same things. They start buying gifts and planning elaborate dates, after barely knowing women at all. And ive told them, that never really helps. Because its super confusing to women and very disrespectful to think throwing money around will help them like you.\n\nAt his core he probably does have decent intentions. But he likes you way too much. He very much wants to skip past all the casual dating parts and jump right into a relationship with you immediately. And in his inexperienced and socially awkward way, he thinks showering you with gifts and over the top expensive dates will get you to want to be in a relationship with him too.\n\nMy suggestion to you if you arent interested is, sit down and have a conversation with him and let him down easy. Give him back the jewelry, be very clear you are not interested in dating him, and maybe give him some advice about dating women in the future. Explain to him how elaborate expensive dates so early make most women uncomfortable and how first dates are supposed to just be casual fun and easy ways to get to know each other. He will appreciate honest feedback that will help him correct his behavior and learn. He will be a bit heartbroken obviously, especially since he had grand ideas in his mind about where this was leading. But explaining to him what hes doing wrong is the only way he might grow from this. Otherwise he'll either do one of two things: withdraw from dating entirely for a while, or do this exact same thing again soon and make another girl very uncomfortable. \n\nBut after the conversation, once youve been clear and talked it out. It is very important that you cut ties with him. Because he will never fully accept the idea that he doesn't have a chance to be with you, and he will stick around your life awkwardly obsessed, hoping one day you'll see him differently. If you give him even a glimmer of hope or continue talking with him regularly, he will misinterpret your friendlyness as him slowly winning you over.\n\nIf you are still somewhat interested in him and want to maybe try out a few dates to see how you feel, just be very careful. Because he is totally invested in you. This isnt casual dating for him. In his mind, you're his future girlfriend and all these dates are like formalities hes try to get out of the way. And hes going to take the rejection so much worse the longer this continues.\n\nOr I could be way off, i dont know either of you at all.

Work on yourself first and maintain a positive, grateful attitude and outlook on life. This is important. Find out what happiness truly means to you. For example, nothings wrong with being alone, but ask yourself why you are lonely. Detail what your mind is holding you back from. Address your red flags for both yourself and who you desire to meet.\n\n2. Dont stop actively looking for a relationship, but dont go in strictly with that mindset. So many things come when you aren't looking. \n\n3. Step out of any comfort zone and make yourself available to meeting people with minimal focus of expecting a relationship. Talk, make friends, and listen to them. So many connections start here and take the pressure off. Im an introvert, so this was hard for me. Dont put more energy out than your social battery can handle. Excuse yourself if you need to. Sometimes, that 'mystery' can work in your favor! If youre more outgoing, let them talk about themselves and listen. Understand where theyre coming from and relate to them with similar experiences. Recognize and roll with these dynamics\n\n4. Become a 'regular' at establishments that you enjoy going to that have people in your range youd want to meet. It could be a bar, club, volunteer, local activity nights that focus on interests (maybe music, food, games, art, whatever youre into). Notice something interesting about someone(s) and lightly engage to learn more about them. \n\n5. Dating apps do work to a degree, but these are limiting and fleeting. Use these as an extension of meeting people, not your sole go-to. Do not go full Dennis System.\n\n6. Be honest. Do not play games to get what you want. This can come off creepy, especially since people can see right through this.\n\n7. Dont take incompatibility or rejection personally. Keep it movement Some people dont click with others. Everyone deserves happiness. If it doesnt work, no sweat, theres others out there for you\n\n8. Stand fast to your boundaries yourself. Value yourself. Dont sell yourself short ignoring your boundaries just to get into a relationship\n\n9. Clean up your appearance, be presentable.\n10. Once you find someone interesting, Invite  them to a 1 on 1 to a low pressure get-together.\n\n10. Be confident. This increases people graviting to you to peel back the layers to get to know you\n\nTL;DR: THIS WORKED WITH ME AND OTHERS I KNOW on a consisten basis May not work for you entirely but it's a start.  (Apologies if this was anecdotal) .", "Working remote, you will definitely have to get out and about. Maybe join a running group or co-ed rec league. Chat with people. Not just with attractive girls, chat with people, because they might know someone who would be a good fit for you. Chat to practice.\n\nI mean, networking is no fun, but maybe one day you go out with a new friend you\u2019re none-too-excited about and you meet someone in the group you relate with, you exchange numbers, and bam! \u201cOut of thin air,\u201d as you say, you find a relationship. \n\nThey really don\u2019t come out of thin air, they come from little connections until you find a strong connection. Be ready for some disappointment, because while I say you might meet someone in a group, that doesn\u2019t mean the first group you go out with or even the fifth group you go out with, but go out regardless.", "My suggestion for dating is to first take inventory of yourself. Ask yourself a whole list of questions. \n\nWho are you and how do you view yourself? What do you see are your pros? What are your cons? Where can you improve? How are you going about doing that?\n\nWhat are you looking for in partner? Why haven't you had the opportunity to meet someone like that? Are the standards or desires too rigid? Does what you want fit who you are? \n\nDating apps are always an option, especially if you have a small or non-existent social circle. Are you putting effort into your look? Into coming off as conventionally attractive? Does that matter to you for yourself or in a partner? \n\nI feel like a lot of young men, start to work on themselves, but not fully. They tend to say they tried everything, but it's work to improve yourself and there will be setbacks. \n\nI've found a lot of success on apps and I'm not super fit or tall. It just works for what I want and how I showcase myself. Apps like Hinge are good for showing off more of you than just pics. \n\nNot to say you need apps, but it's a tool. You shouldn't ignore that a tool could be helpful, but might not always be. A way to meet people is to join clubs, meetup groups, etc. You need to put yourself out there socially to bond and form friendships. From there romantic relationships can be easier to develop. It's hard to join a meetup group just looking for a SO. \n\nYou can certainly approach random women, but that is a skill and if you end up coming off as the dude who approaches random women at a coffee shop or something, it may hurt your chances.

It worked. We dated 3.5 years but our college offers took us separate ways.\n\nI was single again and struggled with just getting chances for years. Met someone I wasn\u2019t super attracted to and we dated for 2 years but she kept trying to mold me into a different person and rush me into marriage.\n\nThen at 27 I suddenly started getting dates with women out of my league. I still think the first woman could\u2019ve been on the bachelor or something. I took advantage of the newfound success to decide that I\u2019d like to start out dating casually.

Similar process to finding dates really, just minus the flirting.\n\nPeople don't find relationships, or friends for that matter, out of thin air. Thats why you get a bunch of adults wondering how to make friends. The secret is you have to put in the effort, go outside your comfort zone and go talk to people.

Just remember that worst case scenario, someone you'll likely never see again thinks you are weird for a day and then forgets your existence. Best case scenario, you've made a friend for life. It's worth it. \n\nFriends make it easier to be invited to things and meet girls, and they also mean if you do find one, theres less pressure on her to be your sole socialisation and support system.

It's important to remember that relationships, even FWB (friends with benefits) arrangements, should be based on mutual respect and clear communication. In this case, it seems like there may be mixed signals and unclear expectations between you and this girl.\n\nFirst and foremost, it's important to prioritize your own well-being and emotional health. If the situation is making you feel empty, confused, and sad, it's important to acknowledge those feelings and take steps to address them. It may be helpful to talk to a trusted friend, family member, about what you're going through and get some outside perspective.\n\nIn terms of how to behave with this girl, it's important to have open and honest communication with her. Express your feelings and concerns to her in a non-judgmental and non-confrontational manner. Ask her about her intentions and expectations in the relationship, and share your own as well. It's important to have clarity about what both of you want and expect from each other.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to set boundaries that align with your own comfort level. If you are not comfortable with the level of intimacy and closeness that is currently present in your relationship, it's okay to communicate that and establish boundaries that feel right for you. It's important to prioritize your own emotional well-being and not engage in any activities or behaviors that make you uncomfortable.\n\nIt's also important to consider your own values and what you want in a relationship. If you are looking for a more traditional romantic relationship with emotional connection and exclusivity, it's okay to acknowledge that and consider whether this situation aligns with your long-term desires. It's important to be true to yourself and not settle for a situation that doesn't meet your emotional needs.\n\nUltimately, it's important to take care of yourself and make decisions that align with your own values and emotional well-being. It may be helpful to have honest conversations with this girl and consider what you truly want in a relationship. If the situation continues to make you feel empty and confused, it may be necessary to reassess the relationship and consider taking steps to prioritize your own emotional health.

I view it as a self respect thing, people rarely change even though fully capable they just don\u2019t care to put in the work & deal with the suffering that\u2019ll come with change, yet it\u2019s worth it in the end.

You got this keep working on you the right person will come along!!! :)", "First off, someone doesn\u2019t just \u201cget\u201d a partner. Dating intentionally is the key aspect here. It sounds like you need some dating practice but also are unsure of what you truly want. Having just any partner isn\u2019t a good thing and the first person to jump in to date you won\u2019t be beneficial if you truly aren\u2019t connecting with that person. But if you aren\u2019t dating intentionally then you shouldn\u2019t be dating at all, not without a clear goal of what you\u2019re looking for in a partner; whether that\u2019s a hookup/FWB, casual dating, exclusivity, or a committed relationship. But it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re ready for exclusivity or a relationship from your post. \n\nI suggest you wait to date until you can write down a list of qualities (physical and non physical). When you\u2019re genuinely and intentionally dating then you\u2019ll ask questions and be interesting because you want to get to know people as potential partners. Dry texting is no good, that will turn anyone away, even someone who\u2019s special. You need to learn how to text and how to be interesting, personal, and ask questions. Once you start to do that on text and in person then you\u2019ll move onto the next stage. \n\nI highly recommend you read some dating books by real dating coaches and YT videos for advice. Go on a bunch of first dates with zero expectations (via Tinder) and get comfortable asking someone questioning about themselves and see if you\u2019re able to connect. This would be for pure practice so you can understand how a first date/dating works. If you never change then your outcome will never change, if your goal is especially to be in a relationship one day. But it honestly doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re there yet.\n\nYou\u2019re also very young. Most people don\u2019t settle down until late 20s-early 30s, so you have plenty of time! Most people in their early 20s around your age want to party, drink, try drugs, go to clubs. They don\u2019t want to settle down. You shouldn\u2019t either because you have a lot of life to live and experience as a 20 year old! I would enjoy your youth. Spend time cultivating hobbies, do some traveling, build new friendships, go and see the world. We change the MOST in our 20s. Our goals change. Our lifestyle changes. What we once thought we wanted in a partner/relationship changes. So it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not going on dates right now, you should not put all your focus on it. In the meantime you can learn and become aquatinted with dating advice, and go on some first (meaningless) dates for practice.", "As a man who has never been in a relationship before I can assure you that women have the upper hand.

I would\u2019ve brought it up but I forgot what he listed his height as. \n\nThat\u2019s not even the biggest issue. He was talking about marriage a lot and what he wanted in a wife.

He said he\u2019s always thinking about the future and not the present. He was talking about wanting 8 kids, but he was okay with 4 cause that\u2019s how many I want. He also talked about not liking cooking and being glad I cook. \n\nHe said he would miss me before our date ended.

My therapist and some people in my support system have advised me that I should show lots of interest in the woman by way of asking lots of questions about them, and avoid going on at length about myself until later in the relationship.\n\nI felt like I did everything right and we had a great conversation for about an hour. She seemed super interested in me and I was very interested in her as well. She was very interested in my career and the stuff I've been doing at work lately since I work in STEM and she is very passionate about STEM education and research. I made sure to show a lot of curiosity in her career and education since that was the way the conversation was going. I even found a way to pay her a compliment in a way that didn't come off as objectifying (I told her that the scarf she is wearing in her profile picture looks great on her).  At one point she even sent the \ud83e\udd29 emoji, which I interpret to be a signifier of being very interested.\n\nWe matched at around 10:30pm and I had an important meeting the following morning at work, so I couldn't stay up too late.  I had sent the last message in the conversation when I went to bed at around midnight. I didn't want to ruin my morning meeting to stay up and see if she would respond. I woke up to see that she responded a while later at about 1:30AM, so I guess she's a bit of a night owl. \n\nI sent a follow-up message to keep the convo going at about 9:00AM that morning (ie. yesterday morning). Then, seeing that she hadn't responded after I got off work at around 5:30pm yesterday I sent another message which was just \"hey, how is your day going?\" She still hasn't responded and it's eating me up inside, even though it's only been a day.\n\nI don't want to be clingy, I just wish there was some kind of validation in these things. I have no idea if I did something wrong. If I double texted and she thought that was too desperate looking, or if she just hasn't opened the app. She was one of those people who sends lots of little bite-size texts in a row rather than one big one, so idk if double texting comes off different. Maybe I wasn't supposed to try to keep texting the very next day? Should I have waited a day to seem less desperate? \n\nMy gut said to just keep the conversation from Wednesday night going, but following my gut has never earned me *any* success in dating. I just wish I knew how my timing and word choice was being interpreted. It's so hard because guys and girls experience these things differently. If a girl messaged me the next day after having matched and tried to keep the conversation going, I would be overjoyed. But I hear many people say that as a guy it looks like I am desperate (which TBF, I am) if I text too frequently.

Over time we\u2019ve noticed that certain things are indicators of potential problems in the future. Red flags, I guess you\u2019d say. And while double texting *eventually* once the relationship is established is totally fine, right at the start it can seem over-eager, and it\u2019s the over-eager guys that seem to cause the most problems, historically. So you have to just play it cool, get over the first little getting to know you hurdle, and then once a relationship or friendship is established, things definitely relax.

Sex is also much more important than money, as it facilitates bonding and rearing of children. Money is one dimensional.

Honestly 2 years ago i tried to compromise with him not working and asked if hed just do basically a full times job worth of house work so at least everything would be clean and stuff would feel more equal. His reason to not do that is that our dogs are so hairy that the floor needs to be swept right after he does it, so in order for him to start, all the dogs need a professional grooming to help the shedding.

It\u2019s too long a story, but the important part is I still have not been able to have a truthful conversation with him about what happened, and that\u2019s on him. And even more heartbreaking because to me he was my best friend too. I have to trust that one day it will make sense and be better. Of course your boyfriend is going to be hurt. That happens to us all at some point. And it\u2019s especially difficult when mental illness is in the picture. But you deserve a good life too that shouldn\u2019t be permanently on hold.

I had a very brief, 1.5 month relationship with a girl last Fall, but other than that I have not dated anyone, mainly for mental health reasons. I have pretty bad anxiety and depression, and substance use with cannabis and historically with alcohol which has isolated me pretty badly. I do have a decent online profile though, so I get a fair amount of likes, and I will occasionally message girls to feel a connection. It just so happens I met two girls who seemed pretty cool around the same time, and two dates were set up.\n\nThe (3) problems:\n\n1. I feel very unworthy of a relationship in my state, and maybe like it's a bad idea. I've already divulged a lot, especially to one girl, and she seems okay with it; she had similar issues in the past, but is extremely outgoing and accomplished (getting masters degree right now, in the news, heavily involved in student gov't). I'm also in school but in undergrad, currently unemployed, a year younger, and very behind for the aforementioned reasons. We got along really well (REALLY well--we had a 7 hr. first date) and I like her. There aren't many people I can talk to that well or get along with. Am I right to be apprehensive about a relationship, or should I trust that things can work out with the right person?\n2. I had another decent first date the next day. The girl seemed nice enough, but I definitely liked the other one more. Thing is, I have never been in this situation, simultaneously having two girls who I would generally get second dates with. I don't know what the expectations are; I'm not committed to either girl, so is it okay if I set up two second dates? I don't know if I even want to, but I feel obligated because:\n3. I can't talk to people well, let alone reject people well. I think it's anxiety related; I have a bad day and I don't respond, and then I let it go too long, and then I have too much anxiety to open the message or think about the person because it's been too long.

Remember, it's only been one date! You should totally go on a second date without any expectations and enjoy it.\n2. It's absolutely OK to date two people at once as long as you're open about it if they ask. When it's at first date stage there should be limited expectations on both sides.\n3.

During our second date, she told me that she was going to be out of town for a couple of weeks. I asked her what she was going to be doing on her trip, and she told me that she was going to spend most of the time in her hotel room producing and promoting content.

This piece of advice was given to me early on by someone I respected greatly and it held up tremendously well: because it avoids festering emotional wounds\n\n* Be respectful of one another and try to nurture each other, this can mean a tiny dose of tough love now and then, but be really careful with that of course - my spouse is autistic for example and I sometimes push her to do stuff I know is hard for her because I know she'll grow from it and she admits it has helped her a lot over time\n\n* Be kind, be excellent to one another and don't give a fuck about what people outside of your bubble might think of you: you don't owe any strangers anything at all, ever. This is **your** life, not theirs.\n\n* Try and do something kind and caring for your SO just because you can. This really goes a long way, all it takes is to think about how you can improve his/her day and then just do it, repeat occasionally and don't fret if it's not perfect - good is still great if repeated \n\n\n\nThat's just a few right off the top of my head.

Let me tell you - he doesn't know better, you do have to tell him and no - he does it cuz it he went about it the wrong way. Mindreading is when either you or the other person expect the other one to actually know what you are thinking, the bond that needs no words. Guess what?!? There is no such thing. Words are used to EXPRESS our wants and desires. If he (or she) does something u don't like and expected a different outcome, talk to him/her about it. U will eventually develop a relationship language, a sort of verbal code, where u say something and he understands completely. But it takes years to develop that and - forewarning - at some point the code may break down and you have to work at it.

It's amazing how many crossed wires can come between a couple and how unnecessarily complicated situations become from a few misunderstood words. If u feel hurt or angry or even happy ask questions and make sure what he said is exactly what you understood. I know it seems kind of dumb, but it will spare you so much pain in the future.

Everyone says the most important aspect to a relationship is communication. But truth be told, Communication is only effective if your partner can comprehend what you're communicating.

Noooooo!!! Understand who they are as a person and you'll know how to be a good partner and if they can be a good one to you. Less trying to be understood, more trying to understand. Never neglect yourself. Let me make that clear. Because it's not about forgetting your needs. But at the end of the day, real love is selfless.

I suggest seeking advice from a therapist or doctor of psychology if you want something useful.\n\nHuman instincts such as feelings, chemistry, spark, or whatever turn of phrase people use for infatuation/crushes/honeymoon phase exist as evolutionary traits that include Genghis selection (continuous generations of children born out of violence, domination, & rape that pass on predilection towards those traits, schadenfreude & horrible aspects of human instinct as a result). Which is to say that human instinct is not logically a good thing, what survives isn't necessarily beneficial and what a person enjoys inherently (what your feelings tell you that you like as attraction) is a direct byproduct of this. It's why the vast majority of men who find success on dating websites are pick up artists, men who neg, and why women consistently vent about the lack of quality men (because the men they filter for and select as a result of their human instinct and feelings rely on the same above process which cares only for successful survival traits, not quality of life or a good relationship). Attractiveness, particularly initial attractiveness, is a trap of your biology. That you are not needing to deal with that is actually a good thing. Go after what you think, not what you feel, is my general advice. As everyone can be attractive and it's far better to get a quality relationship with a great person first. \n;\n\n;\n Love does not magically appear, love is built. Relationships are effort, work, commitment through arguments and difficulty towards a meaningful partnership. Real life isn't a Disney movie and for over a hundred thousand years relationships have often started not out of infatuation, but as a good deal. The wealthy today, rulers of the past, and our most intelligent operate this way, why? Because life is more meaningful shared, because domestic economics scales and gives more leisure time when chores are shared, because finances are cheaper with cooperation and leverage, and because a network of who you know expands with more people. Simply put, as long as a relationship is not actively abusive (as a result of point #1 above) then it has a beneficial impact on your life. This is a cultural norm even in more of the world than not, it's only in western culture that there is an obsession with instinct being observed first (Asian, Jewish, Indian, Arab, and African cultures all have examples every day of starting with transactional relationships and building loving relationships out of them).\n;\n\n;\nIt's not any more selfish to want a better life out of a relationship than anyone else...

You can have _romantic_ feelings for someone, but lack the physical attraction. And that can be a fulfilling dynamic so long as the other person understands the core dynamic relationship.\n\nSome aces have sex because the physical sensation is pleasurable, because the quality time is enriching, or because they like to see their partner happy.

Fact of the matter is that at the very least the guys were attracted to your sisters and became friends but your sisters did give them a chance because they were also attracted to them or became attracted at some point.\n\nNow the difference here is that there is something preventing you from finding people physically/sexually attractive. This is the issue that you have to work on.\n\nHave you ever asked yourself why is the case and actually honestly looked for an answer?\n\nIt's easy to say \"well most men are ugly\" but simply put that isn't the case, or that's not how it works. More likely you either:\n\n\\- Only find attractive people that are objectively gorgeous and far above everyone else in their looks.\n\n\\- Only find someone attractive if they have other attributes that you find desirable (wealth, power, charisma, humor, etc.)\n\n\\- Have a generalized low opinion of men in as a whole which prevents you from finding them attractive.\n\n\\- Have an idealized and unrealistic expectation of your ideal significant other.\n\n\\- Are gay or asexual.\n\nWhatever the reason may be I would suggest to speak to a counselor or psychologist about this because its detrimental to your love life and future happiness.\n\nFinally YES, the solution is giving people a chance but doing so by learning to value their good points which you seem to completely ignore, not settling for someone you don't like, and yes there will also be things that you don't like about your partner and will have to decide how important those are, that's normal.", "Yeah.

It started with trying some more unique pasta sauces, for example, or trying some fish (not my favourite) that was cooked or deep fried.\n\nEventually I started to love not only a lot of different types of food/ingredients, but finding and trying new ones as well.

In fact, women care more about dating taller men than men care about dating shorter women.\n\n>A study on women's and men\u2019s height preferences found that women are most satisfied when their partner was 8 inches (21cm) taller. Men are most satisfied when they are 3 inches (8cm) taller than their partners. Another study found that among men, 13.5 percent prefer to date only women shorter than them. But among women, about half (48.9 percent) preferred to date only men taller than them.\n\n>Relatedly, a study about height and human mate choice found that, on average, the shortest man a woman would date is 5 feet 9 inches tall.

The way people talk on here about women's preference for tall men is said as thought this is some kind of make or break standard when no, its more of a nice-to-have than a must, unless you're talking about a young perfect 10 of a woman who can enforce a rule of wanting someone over 6ft tall because she herself fills multiple physical ideals for  men and can afford to be so picky.\n\nBut as it stands, there are a multitude of cultures throughout the world where the men are roughly as tall as the women. And short guys? American short guys? They absolutely benefit from approaching women from those cultures and backgrounds.\n\nI'm actually coming from the side of the fence here that argues that a large part of Western Women's desire for tall men is intrinsically tied to these \"corporate concerns\" with male choice as opposed to it being a preference by default. Again, as shown by the fact that in multiple cultures throughout the world, there is a much higher tolerance for short men because the women of those cultures don't have it force fed down their throats that all prospective partners need to be the sincere minority of the male population by height.

My problem is I just don\u2019t want all my attempts at relationships to wind up this way, but I don\u2019t beg anyone.\n\nDo I subconsciously find myself attracted to people with issues? To tell the truth, I don\u2019t have the luxury of being picky. I\u2019ve had to take what I can get, and I\u2019ve been burned too many times over the years. Seriously, I can\u2019t make even one relationship work. No, I\u2019m aware enough that trying to rescue people is futile folly.\n\nBut if you consider all the variables, the only choice I seem to have is bad relationships, and after two decades of constant failure, I can\u2019t fool myself into having hope anymore. I don\u2019t know what else I can do. I know myself really well; I\u2019ve had 38 years on my own to meditate on introspection.\n\nSeriously, I think it\u2019s much less foolhardy to just find successful distractions from the prospect of love, because I\u2019ve given up hope, and I think I\u2019m justified in doing so, I\u2019m sad to say. I wish it weren\u2019t the case, but I don\u2019t know what else to do.\n\nThe way I see it, unless there\u2019s something I\u2019m missing, reining in sour emotions with chemicals seems to be the only solid option. I appreciate you taking the time to reach out, though. It was a nice gesture.", "I feel this post in an almost visceral way.  I\u2019m 43 and haven\u2019t been in a relationship in over 10 years, and that one was toxic.  I was married at age 25, divorced at 27, and outside of that relationship only one other one lasted over a year.  So I guess you could say I\u2019ve had successes, but it sure doesn\u2019t feel like it.\n\nI\u2019ve never been good at meeting people - basically I\u2019ve only ever met people through work.  And as time went on, I knew that in order to make a better living in what I do (cooking), I had to move up to management.  Now I\u2019m in a spot where the people I work with are off limits because I\u2019m a manager.  And also, most of them are significantly younger - you don\u2019t find many people past their mid 30s in restaurants.  Dating younger wouldn\u2019t bother me but I know it\u2019d get the side eye from most.  But it doesn\u2019t matter because like I said, management.\n\nI too wish I could just forget about wanting a relationship, but I can\u2019t.  I know, I should get out and meet people with common interests, blah blah - never has worked for me that way.  I\u2019m quite introverted until I get to know someone or until a situation (like the stress of work) pushes me out of my comfort zone.  I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and take medication for depression but that only helps me with motivation for daily tasks, not with the feelings of loneliness.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to tell you, other than you\u2019re not alone.", "I think a lot of people try to find these store-bought made up women instead of average looking people.

But the same way you see sex as a crutch to keep a relationship going, abstinence can act the same when you stay together for just your personalities and then are sexually incompatible.

Sexual compatibility is right up there with moral/ethical compatibility, wanting to have kids or not, etc. It's VERY important.

If a guy put this arbitrary timeline on a relationship in the FIRST CONVERSATION I had with them, I would 100% run for the hills. \n\nAlso, think of it this way: whether or not it's true, she is going to feel like you are not attracted to her for those 6 months.

Personal slow approach is just gaining friends and building that connection over time. Find people that you bond with and if at any point you both want to, you can test dating, if it doesn\u2019t work, it just means that you weren\u2019t compatible and are better as friends.\n\nMy best relationships started from my friends and you aren\u2019t obligated to be sexual with your friends.

I could see scenarios where people met in a non dating setting, became friends, and then after having an established relationship, began to add sex or romance into the mix. But in a relationship that starts out with the pretense of dating each other, it just seems a bit overboard. I totally get wanting to take things slow, but just removing a crucial part of most romantic partnerships doesn\u2019t necessarily strengthen the other parts. And like other people were saying, I\u2019d rather know early on if we were sexually compatible, so I\u2019d have trouble hanging around not knowing for so long. And to your point about wanting the other parts of the relationship to not use sex as a crutch: I don\u2019t think removing sex is the healthiest way to deal with that potential problem. Id rather know how the relationship is balanced with sex early on. Sure, relationships can rely too heavily on sex and it could be the main thing keeping things together, but then the next step should be having a conversation about that and working through why it is that sex seems to be the only common ground. Even if you wait six months to add sex into the mix, you\u2019ll still have to do the work of making sure the relationship is balanced, so adding an arbitrary 6 month no sex period seems unnecessary and to miss the point of the problem.", "In half a year, I could have achieved a new qualification, built a small house, have bought a car, gotten a work promotion, have learned a new hobby, and much more.\n\nIf you're expecting anyone to put their life on hold just BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SURE, that's pretty unreasonable. Realistically, you'd have to be some pretty valuable stock to be worth waiting around for, and not many people are...\n\nRealistically the most passionate and fastest building of intimacy happens in the first few months.

That said, very few people will be on board with it. \n\nIt does seem a little long, but I understand not wanting your heart broken more than it needs to be.\n\nI think you should ask WHY you feel like 6 months is the right time period to wait. Personally, I dislike hard deadlines in relationships. The idea of \"you have to kiss her on the first date...end in bed on the third\" etc. If you really mesh things will move quickly, if one of you has been hurt (and even if they took time to recover) it'll move slower. Similarly, if one of you is REALLY busy with work but does want to have and maintain a relationship, it'll slow down, even if your putting work into it. That's just life.\n\nI don't think waiting to be intimate is an issue, and if it takes 6 months it takes 6 months, but I would be leery of someone who has a hard time frame for it.\n\nI would politely suggest instead of a hard deadline, examine what you think you would have or need to have in \"6 months\" that is the clicker for you.

Instead of saying 6 months say something like \"I'm not comfortable having sex until I feel comfortable, or until I know this is something long-term etc.\"\n\nAlso, I would recommend you remove any mentions to a sex-time frame so your profile just reads \"I don't do hookups\" even then...as the dude you're the one reaching out a lot I bet, so I'm not sure if it's actually doing anything for you.", "OP it sounds like you shouldn\u2019t be dating people who are dating for relationships.\n\nIt sounds like you should just be making friends with people and after you are close enough friends then you see about dating them.\n\nCause 6 months is arbitrary and you\u2019re gonna scare most people away with that.", "I think waiting until you have an emotional connection makes sense, but a specific mandatory wait time is strange to me. Physical, emotional, and esxual chemistry are really deeply important to a relationship.

Physical intimacy is an important aspect of a relationship to me. While I\u2019m do prefer to wait until a solid connection is established, I won\u2019t put a time frame on that. I\u2019ve had experiences where the connection was immediate, other times when it grew over longer periods - but never six months.

I\u2019m not saying this to be rude or insulting but by creating a timeline for a relationship you sort of destroy the beautifully organic and spontaneous nature of intimacy.", "I think personally this is excessive. Most people with normal libido wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. At the beginning of a relationship, typically when you\u2019re really into someone, you fuck like bunnies.

It's fine to recognise in yourself that in prior relationships, you haven't felt that emotional intimacy in the first few months.

It should be dependent upon how you feel and less about the precise number of months. To me it just feels as tho it\u2019s the wrong thing to be focusing on. It also feels like you see all relationships the same way and that doesn\u2019t allow for anyone to feel special or unique. \n\nThat\u2019s not to say you don\u2019t have the right to define such boundaries, but I can certainly see why a lot of people would be weary of someone who was so focused on them.", "This really depends on what you mean by intimacy and I would be clear about that if you can. \n\nDoes this mean no intercourse, does it mean nothing sexual at all, does it mean no kissing, does it mean no cuddling, does it mean no hand holding? \n\nDifferent people have different expectations, so depending on where that line falls you will be restricting the people who are interested in you. \n\nJust no intercourse is going to turn people away, but I don't find it unreasonable, in fact I would find it preferable to build something first.\n\nHowever no touching at all would be a deal breaker for me and I would hard pass there, a relationship should be different from a normal friendship.\n\nI would also be concerned with a specific timeframe. The idea would be holding off until feeling comfortable, OR, even if still not within boundaries, setting that time frame to make it clear when you might want to test them.", "There's nothing wrong with your boundaries. Thats completely a personal choice. Are you a male?\nI'll tell you my perspective as a female, I also take things very slow and ive never had sex. So I would appreciate a guy who has the same approach and respects and understands my space. So I get where you're coming from. But the only I'll thing say - putting such a strict number is kind of odd. Especially to put something like that on your profile. \"6 months minimum\" it just seems so in your face, you know? I always feel when it comes to something so emotional like dating and relationships, you should never put such a strict timeline to it. Like \"I have to get married by next year\" or \"I'll only have sex after 6 months of knowing him/her\", or \"i have to have a baby at the age of 30\". You have to allow yourself to feel and go with the flow of the moment. Now whether that 6 months ends up being 3 months or 1 year, that's fine. But don't set a timer beforehand.", "You\u2019re in a tough spot here. you hold similar physical boundaries to the religious folk but aren\u2019t compatible due to the different beliefs. On  the other hand, you\u2019d be very hard pressed to find someone that is looking for a sexual relationship but is willing to abstain that six month period. I understand where you\u2019re coming from, my first gf had a 6 month rule before kissing and I was fine with that. (Although we were both 16 so I think it was more her parents decision lol). The best advice is remove the arbitrary 6 month deadline. Be up front and say you want to take things really really slow but don\u2019t set a rigid deadline. I\u2019m sure you could be comfortable with someone at the 4 or 5 month mark or even sooner. It\u2019s gonna change based on the romantic connection", "It's not unreasonable. \n\nBut many women who have an average sex drive and are looking for regular sexual activity as part of a relationship will be incompatible with your dealbreaker. I would never consider waiting at least 6 months to find out if I'm sexually compatible with a guy I've been dating. \n\nHighlight on your profile that you are only looking for serious relationships with compatible women who are seeking to date to find a partner with long term potential and will 'wait at least 6 months before sleeping with anyone'. \n\nGood luck!", "I don\u2019t think is unreasonable and you shouldn\u2019t reword it. However, 99% of people on dating apps are in there for hookups so, waiting 6 months is not reasonable. They want the hookup first and then, in some cases, a relationship. You want the opposite, which is completely fine. \n\nAlso you don\u2019t have to be find \u201ca religious girl\u201d there are multiple women out there wanting a connection first an willing to go with the flow and wait to have intimacy.", "Not unreasonable at all. Keep in mind most have the attitude of looking for quick hookups on online dating. I agree ,,taking things slow\" is vague (what does that mean? A few dates? Few weeks?). That being said, the way You phrased it sounds kinda cold. 6 months is pretty arbitrary and gives off some calculated figures vibe. Perhaps You may want to rephrase into ,,half a year\". It's literally the same time period, but without the actual digit, which makes it look more reasonable. In general, ,,I don't have sex until X time\" sounds like bombarding a potential viewer with conditions, to avoid that but still convey the same message I'd do something along the lines of ,,lookig for long term relationship, sex once I'm sure this is serious (months - half a year into)\".\n\n\nTL;DR I'd rephrase it but the idea itself is perfectly rational", "\"I'm not quick to hook up. In the past it's taken me about 6 months to build a relationship up to sex. Let's have fun together and see where things go!\"\n\nPersonally, I date to have sex and build relationships. I'm assuming you would want exclusivity during this time as well, so many people will politely decline. Not having sex for 6 months is pretty standard when single or if there's a medical issue ect. with your partner. That level of self control is valued and you're not doing anything wrong. There's a lot of people who prefer this.\n\nThere will also be a lot of people who won't want to put off partnered sex for that long if they are actively dating. Dating comes with a lot of rejection, some arbitrary and some meaningful. You have a core belief that deserves compatibility. When people unmatch you it's not an insult. You don't want to date people who are after sex in the first 6 months so it's good that they let themselves go.\n\nMake sure you aren't looking down on other people's sexuality though. Not so you can date them, but to be a good person. There's nothing wrong with having sex and not vetting people for months beforehand. You have a preference, but it's not superior and other people should be free to reject it for themselves.", "Yes, because there is a lack of physical intimacy taking place. The whole point of a romantic relationship is to have sex.", "In a world for full hook up culture, I think waiting is the right thing to do. Wait for as long as you need to.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why people are in such a rush to sleep together when dating can be so much fun.\n\nBuilding up a relationship is way more important than empty, meaningless sex.\nSo many women have been conditioned to sleep around since the pill came out.\nThe pill is just a tool to help unwanted pregnancy. It is not a passport into heartbreak town.\n\nWaiting at least 2-3 months is not that long because it ensures that you will be compatible in the long run.\nPeople who have sex early quite often find out later that they are incompatible.\n\nWhy not get to know the person before you sleep together. It\u2019s one way to minimise sharing something special with the wrong person.\nSex shouldn\u2019t be such a casual thing like ordering pizza or walking in the park.\n\nMost people confuse the chemical highs of sex for love and compatibility.\n\nAlso, even in a world with contraception, STDs and unwanted pregnancies still happen.\nIf you cannot wait then long term relationships aren\u2019t really your thing.\n\nI agree with OP. Waiting is not wrong. How long you wait though, should be determined keeping in mind what sits right with you but I\u2019d say at least two months.", "Why the strict timeline? I understand wanting to establish your relationship more, but the length of time that might take will vary from relationship to relationship. You can take as much time as you need, but for most people, setting aside six months of serious dating before you assess sexual compatibility is going to be an instant no.\n\nSomething you might want to try is laying it out in a way that allows for the possibility of some flexibility, like saying no hookups, looking for something serious, i don\u2019t want to get physical with someone I\u2019m not in a committed relationship with. Then, if they bring up the timeline, you could say you don\u2019t see yourself getting to that point until you\u2019re 6 months in, but opening with it in your bio is going to get some instant left swipes, especially since tinder in particular is so focused on instant gratification; nobody has time to wait half a year just to get laid lol", "I think its unreasonable. I wanted to take things slow but it's not something you need to state before even a date.\n\nWhy does it have to be on a specific time frame it seems very rigid and takes away any romance or chemistry. Have sex when you want to have sex? \n\nAlso women like sex just as much as men so if I was dating someone for 6 months and not getting any ... hell it just wouldn't happen. Partly because I'd be worried if it's bad then I've wasted 6 months to find this incompatibility as I think it's important in a long term relationship. Not the most important but I value it in my relationship.", "I don't think that it's unreasonable and I think that being very clear in your profile is a good start. That way everyone knows up front, what you are looking for. That being said, sexual chemistry is extremely important to a lot of people. I have slept with someone and immediately changed my view on the relationship because we weren't a good match sexually. It would suck to wait 6 months and then realize that you arent compatible in the bedroom.", "To me, yes. I'm a cis straight female. I need to be sure I'm not wasting 6 months just to have bad sex. I prefer sex earlier on, so I know what I can expect. After 6 months, I'd like to be in a relationship with the person, but I don't want to be in a relationship with someone that I am not sexually compatible with. And what if I already fell in love with them and then find that out. That would not work for me.\n\nBut, I will also tell you to do what you want. If you want to wait 6 months, that's alright too. You're different then me and that's okay. If you don't feel comfortable having sex early on, then don't do it. Try to find someone who is more similar to you in that aspect.", "It can be unreasonable but there's more too it\n\nLike if you're a single mom and the kid came from one night stands... ya expecting 6 months is going to be seen as unreasonable\n\nBut if you have made any and every man you have had relationships with wait 6 months then thats not unreasonable\n\nBut alot of men are going to lean closer to the idea that other dudes have gotten sex from you for a lot less and in a fraction of that time, so they aren't going to want to wait\n\nIt sucks but with hook up culture being so mainstream you are going to be fighting up hill to find a guy willing to wait that long\n\nPersonally, I would ask questions if I was told 6 months and from there decide if you're worth the wait, but most people are just going to cut the loses and move on", "It\u2019s a fine boundary to have, but it\u2019s also not wrong for people to not want to waste their time with it. r/DeadBedrooms can show you just how much physical intimacy can cause strife in a relationship.

It necessarily mean sex). Dating some one for 6 months to then find out that you are not at all compatible in that are is unreasonable. \n\n\nI will say I think I may understand where you're coming from.\n\n I personally don't like to date strangers, and typically am not genuinely attracted to a person until I've had a chance to get to know them and feel comfortable around them. For me this has meant I started out as friends first with the women I've later ended up dating. \n\nThis is a perfectly reasonable way to go about finding a partner as long as you're always honest.

Sometimes I got it wrong and was upset by a guy\u2019s behaviour-sometimes I got it right and walked away relatively unscathed. And many times I had a fantastic time.

Also if you are not opposed to exploring other realms of intimacy or sexuality I think that deserves to be a part of any conversation you have with a potential partner. \n\nAnother thought: you could leave off the boundary from your profile. Put something like: \u201cnot looking for a hook up\u201d instead. Then when you go out with people (for a short date like coffee or ice cream/walk in the park) you could tell them then. In person might be more favorable bc then they get to experience a bit of you and your personality.

If they\u2019re high libido, or even just feeling high libido right now, it could be a red flag for them. If you\u2019ve ever read any of the stories from the DeadBedroom sub, it really makes it clear how important intimacy and sexual compatibility are to a relationship, even if they aren\u2019t the same thing, they very much effect one another.

Potential partners also have the right to decide that they don\u2019t want to pursue a relationship where they will have to wait 6 months to be intimate with you. If this boundary is causing issues for you, you might want to have an honest conversation with yourself: why do I even have this boundary in the first place? Why six months in particular?

I\u2019ve had GFs with whom I had to wait 1-2 months. The difference was how well we clicked and how the relationship was progressing. I\u2019ve had to wait the longest (3 months) in my WORST relationship. It took 3 months because we did not click at all.\n\n\nAlso let\u2019s add to this. If you believe that \u201cthe time\u201d can be defined as a completely made up timeframe, what else will you make up during the relationship? Ok, we *have* to get engaged after 12 months. Ok we *have* to get married after 24 months. Ok we\u2019ve been together for 4 years, we *have* to have kids. Life is more complicated than this.

But unreasonable to expect most people/anyone to agree to this. I feel like intimacy is a huge part in a relationship, if you don\u2019t have good chemistry then what\u2019s the point?

We live in a world where a lot of people are more likely to have casual sex than give some flowers or write a cute letter or something silly like that.\n\nThat being said, what feels the most \"unreasonable\" here is that you're setting a relatively arbitrary timeline for intamacy, and it's kinda weird to set a 6 month limit, rather than just saying \"it might take me a few months\". It's sort of rigid to say 6 months when it sort of implies a lack of flexibility, refusal to acknowledge a posibility that you guys might click early. In this sort of fast dating world, most people have already moved on at like, the second date if things don't click, so it'll be hard to find people willing to stick around super long if sparks aren't flying in the first few weeks anyways. \n\nI don't find your expectations unreasonable per se.

But even with all of that said, there\u2019s a lot more to a relationship than just sex. IMO the larger issue with modern relationships is that people have started putting way too much importance on physical attraction and sexual attraction, to the point where people seek out others that fit those preferences FIRST, then they worry about everything else after that.

I guess what people will have an issue with is putting an exact date on it instead of saying \"I don't want sex until I feel we have built a strong relationship\".

Or why wait? Your body, your choice, of course, but putting pressure on maintaining Timelines I've found leads to worse relationships, since important moments become more artificial.\n\nExample: you're getting hot and heavy 3 weeks into dating, and despite you both wanting to, you stop because you still have 5 months, 1 week, left before you're \"allowed\". Verbalizing it is probably the best idea, since it won't lead to miscommunication with your partner, but if they respect that boundary, you have now put a mark on their calendar for when they'll \"try\" again. Not to say you can't be physically affectionate, but for most people this becomes a pretty watered down relationship.\n\nEven as someone who doesn't put a priority on sex, a 6 month hard-line would probably be a no go for me. I'm not going to commit to trying on date #2, of course, but I prefer my relationships with people to be more organic than sticking to rules on how a relationship should progress.", "That\u2019s completely reasonable and normal. That process though doesn\u2019t take a completely arbitrary amount of time (ex 6 months). It\u2019s a process and a feel that happens over time and is more a feeling than a hard rule.

Then if they say they are also looking for that, lay out what you mean and hat you think that would look like. Emphasize you are looking to date exclusively and looking for a girlfriend and that you want to be in a relationship and know each other six months before being intimate.

And yeah, I'm extremely familiar with what consent means and looks like, since I'm extremely active in sexual assault prevention communities, lol, so thanks for asking. First of all, I said it BORDERS on non consent. If you don't want to have sex more often but are doing so to make someone else happy, that is absolutely bordering on non-consent, because you do not want to do it. Consent should be enthusiastic and ongoing. Being pressured into consenting to avoid conflict within a relationship is not enthusiastic consent. Consent that is obtained under pressure, influence or threat, including threat of a break up, is not true consent. Consent obtained with conditions like \"if you don't have sex with me more then I will cheat on you\" is not true consent. It sounds like YOU need to educate yourself on what consent really looks like. \n\nSecondly, nowhere did I even say the words \"not acceptable\". You as an adult CAN make that choice. But as MANY of us have figured out the hard way, it is a bad one that often leads to ruin because we have learned that sexual incompatibility CANNOT be compromised on, and NOT for lack of trying. Make the choice if you want, but the rest of us who know better are going to continue LEARNING from our mistakes. Sex isn't just a bonus side to a relationship. For many, sex is an essential part. It doesn't have to be for you. You can decide for yourself what is important to you and what you are and are not comfortable with. But for the vast majority of us, INCOMPATIBILITY is not compromises or.

In order to find something similar, I looked for traditional traits in the men I dated. I'll be completely honest and admit that I had high expectations. I wanted a man that opened my car door, complimented me, surprised me with wild flowers or any other small gesture. I didn't necessarily express that to the guys I dated, but I wouldn't be inclined to continue dating them if I didn't think they met those standards after the first few dates.

On first dates, I always insisted on 50/50, but I agree that taking turns is more cutesy. I honestly like it now when it's just kinda \"vibes\" with my current boyfriend. But some girls definitely do really care about the guy paying every time and that's a dealbreaker kinda thing for some. At least OP found out now rather than later that that may be an incompatibility. It really is a matter of what kind of woman someone is looking for here. There are plenty of women who will offer to pay for the second one or who from the get-go will try to establish 50/50 splits.", "I agree with what you said.

Guys that were using me for sex or as someone to pass the time with were the guys asking me to split tabs.\n\nI think it is indicative of a man's interest and excitement level.

But on the other hand I don\u2019t want to the guy to think I\u2019m just using him. So what I\u2019ve been doing is if he invited me out to say a game, I\u2019ll offer to pay for the parking.

Good looking people, like financially well off individuals, do not spare the advantages that life gives them in order to get an upper hand. There's a solid reason why the trope of a beautiful person paired up with a homely wealthy one is still going strong. It's the oldest trope in the book and one that's unlikely to ever change. \n\nI have to disagree, tbh. I mean, your experiences are your own but in my personal life I just haven't found that to be true. At least as a woman, it's been made obvious that when men have the funds, they take no issue in using their money to compete with other men for the type of woman they want. Also? I've dated a few men who were financially better off than most men and they were pretty generous for no reason other than they wanted to be, and they could. One of those guys was an asshole and I promise you, there was no amount of money he could throw around that was keeping me around.\n\nBut also?\n\nMost normal, average, middle-class people also don't walk around fearing that they're going to be used for money.

Both sides have similar criterias. However, since the man is usually breadwinner, the bank account balance matters more. It is needed to sustain the family. Most of the girls aren't interested in a minimalistic lifestyle and Capital is indeed very important. You can debate this if you want, but money are well being are kind of directly proportional upto an extent. \n\nLadies generally run the house. Therefore, they are usually beautiful, nurturing, kind (the feminine features people call them). Someone people would like to be around a lot. They are also more thoughtful and Excel more in the expressive subjects such as Arts and Languages more than boys. This can be traced back to long back on the timeline. Our goddess Lakshmi, beautiful, kind, nurturing, manages finances. Aphrodite, goddess of beauty.\n\nThe deities tell you a lot about how society worked. \n\nAlso, ladies do end up marrying very old, not so good looking people for money as well.

There was a guy pursuing me once who basically led with his career/income. He had no idea how much I made and kept bringing up that he was making a bit over six figures. In this situation I didn't even bother with the guy because I'm not after your money for one, and for two I feel like if you're using money to try and get my attention, then you'll start being resentful if we don't work out. I also don't want someone who is attached to money as a status. It's a resource. \n\nThe guys I've dated never have flaunted their income or wealth and definitely wouldnt dare do so for a date. I'm also a very naturally nurturing person. So in relationships I pour into my partner to make sure they always feel appreciated and respected. For instance I always make sure my partner's favorite beer is in the fridge when he gets off work. I drive an hour out of town to get it when he runs out. And if I'm done work before him, his dinner is warmed. I give him the space to play his video games after work before I start ranting about anything. When he's stressed from work I arrange fun dates he's never tried. I never let him doubt how much he means to me, I never play games, never yell, etc. I wake up early and make us both breakfast before work so he never has to be grumpy going to the office. I'm a morning person he isn't he moves slow like a sloth lol but I know how badly his day will go if he doesn't eat before he goes in.  It's not a big deal to me but he says no woman has ever done this stuff for him and it makes him feel loved. In turn that makes him want to provide for me even though he knows how much I make.

I doubt that you're putting that much effort into yourself and your appearance for the sake of securing someone who isn't attractive too. Regardless, an attractive woman still more likely to be putting in money, time and effort into her appearance, probably more than what your dinner date covers, so whenever guys throw these fits over paying for dates its like listen, you're free to go date a different class of woman - one who does not put the effort into herself and will be thrilled to split the tab with a hot, financially stable guy. But you know who you're going after, and why. Don't act brand new to this Earth.\n\nNow, I'm with you 100000% on her needing to demonstrate appreciation and thoughtfulness.

I don't really have to put it out there like that though, I am thoughtful when I like a guy and will buy drinks, movie tickets, and if I really like him?

I learned that people with low sex drives don't necessarily want less sex, they're just not as easily turned on and getting them turned on is a roadtrip, not a quick drive. \n\nThey require a lot more work to warm up, to the point where it can be an entire day's worth of work and if you love the person, you'll do it for them.

Learn skills, hobbies, travel, practice talking to people if you're shy like I am,  ect. That will help you grow as a person. For some reason, actively looking for a relationship gives off a sense of desperation.  You'll attract what you are. So then you'll attract someone who is also desperate.

Don't major in engineering.\n\n2. If you major in engineering, do NOT major in mechanical engineering. I couldn't tell you why but it is a serious sausage fest. \n\n3. Ok actual advice time. Your appearance matters. With that said, be yourself and don't change everything about who you are and how you look just with the hope that it'll help you get women. \n\nBut, do bear in mind that how you present yourself matters. You don't have to be naturally handsome and you don't have to wear the most expensive clothes or spend an hour on your hair every morning, but you should show that you at least care about your looks. \n\nI don't know what you look like, but this advice is coming from someone who had the worst haircuts and only ever wore T-shirts and blue jeans for waaay too long. Mix it up a little, have some variety, but stay true to yourself. \n\n4. Be yourself. Don't try to be anything you're not. Take an interest in other people's hobbies and be open to trying new things, but if it's not for you that's ok! You are your own unique self, don't try to be like someone else just to fit in, do what makes you happy and don't try to please others. \n\n5. Be friendly, but not too friendly. Don't look at women as dating objects, they are people. What I mean by this is don't approach a girl with the idea already in your head that you want to date her, and don't talk to her like that either. Be nice, friendly, and approach everyone you meet as a potential friend. \n\nIf the dialogue is going well you can step it up a notch and start making moves. Listen to what she says, watch her body language, and if she doesn't like you don't force it. Be polite and courteous, but don't act desperate for a date. If it's mutual it will come naturally, if not, there's nothing wrong with having more friends. \n\n6. Other people recommended trying new skills and hobbies to meet people. This one is 50/50 for me. While it's a great thing to go out and try things, don't view trying new hobbies / activities as a dating method. It's very situational, but not everyone in hobby / activity groups are trying to date and don't really wanna be hit on. You can argue for it both ways, some people see it solely as a way of meeting potential partners and others avoid it specifically because of the guys who are just in it for that. \n\nThat said, what I would recommend is working on yourself. Be you, try new stuff, learn new skills, and embrace the fact that you don't know everything (be a life long learner)! If you have a natural passion for something, people will always see that in you. It genuinely adds to your personality and sense of self and can make you more confident about who you are and what you like to do, regardless of others. \n\nLike I said before, don't compare yourself to others, and focus on being your best self for your sake. People will gravitate towards someone who is self confident, skillful, and determined to try. You don't have to be the best at anything, you just have to find a way to have fun and enjoy what you do! \n\nI hope this helps, good luck in college and make the most of your time!", "lol I'm not the OP bro. \n\nBut to reply to your point:\n\n> Explain this to me. If you took a woman out, can you afford to take her out to a restaurant and pay $250 for dinner? How about drinks? My first girlfriend at 27 I spent probably $1,800 on dinners alone. I bought her gifts for another $500. I spent money on drinks and paid for all of my personal expenses too.\n\nCould I afford to? Yes (well because you know... i'm not the 19 year kid that made the thread). Would I? Depends - moderately. I don't need to throw money at a women to keep her attracted to me. All my dates that turned into relationships were literally walks in a park, coffee or some fun activity (that's not the standard boring shit). I don't need to spend money to keep a women interested. My attraction, personality and charisma takes care of that. Sure, when you're in a relationship, treat her to a dinner here and there or a gift. But, If you want to flex your money to keep a woman attracted, that's fair enough - you do you. Just don't think OP needs to do that to get a girlfriend lmao.

Our views and plans on child-rearing, religious values, moral values, life goals, communication, and financial decisions are extremely specific and mirror each other almost perfectly.\n\nTo put this in context, both of us are Orthodox Jews with a very specific rationalist view of religion that is exceedingly rare. We are both very committed to living a specific Orthodox Jewish lifestyle that is probably the rarest I've found within Orthodoxy. We both view child-rearing through a lens of developmental psychology. We are both very committed to our values, and both value integrity very highly. We both want to make a lot of money early on, not out of a desire for materialism, but to make sure we can provide for our kids and stay home with them when needed. Both of us value homeschooling. Both of us have done a lot of research into communication with a partner/with other people, also through a lens of psychology.\n\nWe are both much more intelligent than average and have felt very alone because of it, and we find a lot of comfort in each other.

We've both done a lot of research into what makes a good relationship (both independently and together), have read relationship self-help books together, and constantly have conversations about how to improve our relationship and how to support each other as much as possible. When our desires conflict, we discuss what we both want and are both ready not only to compromise, but to completely give up what we want if we think the other person deserves their thing more.\n\nHe challenges me intellectually but is also able to be a goof.

These days, I'm maybe two in the first hour and maybe another over the course of two more hours. I would never sit and drink for 7 hours, But if I did I would not keep drinking one per hour.

But OP has every right to at least be concerned. Especially drinking hard alcohol. That's a lot of alcohol. I think it's pretty likely that he drinks a lot more than a couple of times a week, and drinking that much on a first date without even giving it a second thought and probably tells you a lot about his attitudes towards alcohol consumption.

As his alcoholism progresses there are certain markers on the path of alcoholism that will cause her more and more suffering: he won\u2019t be home in the evenings consistently. If he is the type that drinks at home, she will have a drunk toddler to deal with (husband). If she has children with him, she will eventually have to tell them their dad is a useless drunk or she will lie to them to \u201cprotect\u201d them from his drunken behavior.  \n\nShe will have to beg, bargain, plead with him to cut down on his drinking, but none of her pleading will be effective.

As a relationship and dating coach, here's what I can share:\n\nIt's understandable that you're concerned about the amount of alcohol your date consumed during your first date. While it's not uncommon for people to have a few drinks while out on a date, 9 martinis is a lot, and it's important to consider whether this behavior is a one-time thing or a pattern.  \nIt's possible that your date simply got caught up in the moment and ended up drinking more than he intended. However, if he has a history of excessive drinking or if you notice this behavior again on future dates, it could be a red flag for potential issues with alcohol.  \nIt's important to communicate your concerns with him and see how he responds. If he is defensive or dismissive of your concerns, it may be a sign that he is not willing to address potential issues with alcohol. On the other hand, if he acknowledges your concerns and is willing to make changes, it could be a positive sign.  \nUltimately, it's up to you to decide what you're comfortable with and what you're looking for in a partner. Trust your instincts and take the time to get to know him better before making any decisions. If you'd like to talk about this more or if you need further dating advice, my DMs are open!", "I mean it sounds like you both had an amazing date and the 9 drinks seems to be his only flaw. I would go out with him and see if the same thing keep occurring. You're not in the relationship yet but I would just keep an eye out for that.", "I\u2019m sober so it would be a red flag for me (looking for someone who doesn\u2019t drink or drinks very moderately). It depends entirely on your relationship with alcohol, but it isn\u2019t inherently a red flag.", "I had an uncle who could do this. He\u2019s now deceased, and spent the last decade of his life as a shell of a person (alcohol-related dementia). He was a Vietnam veteran, and self medicated for PTSD. It was sad to see. He could consume a case of beer, plus numerous shots of scotch in one evening (probably right around 6-7 hours of drinking). Oddly enough, I never remember him being drunk. He was functional, until his mind started going. Again, his end was horrible, and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on anyone. \n\nI think most doctors agree that anything more than 1-2 drinks in one evening can signal a problem. Regardless, it\u2019s definitely not good for your physical health. This level of drinking will have consequences. Since this guy is 30, I doubt he\u2019s feeling the negative effects at this point. Give it another 5-10 years. Anyone I know who died, as a result of alcohol abuse, had been drinking heavily for decades. These were functional alcoholics, if you will. \n\nI have dated a few heavy drinkers. It never lasted, because the lifestyle is not sustainable for a long term relationship. I don\u2019t drink much, because I don\u2019t tolerate alcohol well (bad headaches, etc). I\u2019m not judgmental about it. I know it\u2019s a disease, and a difficult thing to give up. My advice: be acutely aware of what you\u2019re getting yourself into. Alcoholics are not bad people. My uncle wouldn\u2019t have hurt a fly. But, the impact it had on his family was significant. No amount of begging or pleading from my aunt and cousins ever got through to him. \ud83d\ude1e", "I'm fine with her considering this a red flag so he will be saved from a relationship of constant nitpicking when he's done nothing wrong.", "I didn't say he was an alcoholic.

You certainly disprove any absolutes.

He may grow out of it over time and he may never get particularly drunk have any ill effect whatsoever. So OP may well be perfectly capable of having a fine relationship with someone who has a perfectly fine relationship with alcohol. But they're most likely a heavy drinker. Just the fact that someone would think nothing of consuming that many drinks in front of a first date tells me that most likely they have rather liberal attitude towards alcohol consumption. Make of that what you will.", "lol, yes, health reasons, it has loads of input, any addiction is damaging to a relationship.

I really hate how often people blame shit on gender that is something done by people of all genders. \"You should leave me, they'd be better for you\" is something people with low self esteem say and it's also something that manipulators say. NO ONE who says it means it but it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that drives the person away ---just like they said would happen. You were in a relationship with a fucked up woman who wanted you to say \"I will never leave you for her, you're what's best for me\" and you didn't say that. That's what a guy would want to hear if the situation were reversed. It's not like it's a surprise to you that this woman had some fucked up issues. That's all this was. Don't be dragging all women into this as if it's okay to generalize about a gender.\n\nEDITED: Sorry I made the mistake of saying \"ALL\" in that last sentence. I should have said some. However it's still not okay to generalize about a gender or make an issue gendered when all genders do the same exact thing, for the same exact reasons, as illustrated in all the other sentences in my comment.

It's okay to take things slow and get to know someone without trying to push for a romantic connection right away. If you're interested in someone, make sure to communicate that and show genuine interest in getting to know them. It's also important to be respectful of boundaries and not try to push for physical intimacy before someone is ready.  \nIn terms of improving your dating experiences, it may be helpful to reflect on your past dates and think about what went well and what didn't.

It just means that you don\u2019t excel at that awkward set up of a date and you might need to go about it a different way.", "\"I don\u2019t know if she thought we are just incompatible?\"\n\nProbably, and you must understand this: That she dismisses you after only two dates is totally on her, so don't worry that much. See, she - of course - has the right to reject you, that I won't dispute. But there's usually two types of people who dismiss their dates this way: Those who never felt any attraction in the first place - if that should be the case, she should have come clean earlier. Or those who have a huge checklist of things they look for in a partner and dismiss their date as soon as one of the boxes don't check. Which translates as: Super high expectations from their side - so again, don't worry because that is less about you and more about them.\n\nThen again, be happy that she's straight forward enough to tell you that she does not see a match for herself and actually tells you just that in a respectful way. Cause that is quite rare: Usually men end up being ghosted or whatever. So props to her for actually communicating what's going on.  \n\n\nWhen it comes to \"being more romantic\": Stop overthinking and understand that she basically just phrased it that way in order to not smack you in the face with a blunt \"Nah, I have no interest in you\". You got to be you at all times - otherwise you'll never get a proper relationship going. Don't look for ways to bend for other people just to seem \"more romantic\" or whatever. Instead, do some introspective work and get to know yourself. Do you know what your love languages are? Do you know what you look for in a partner? Do you know how you work in terms of intimacy and sexuality? Those are things to figure out, because if you don't, you won't get things on. It is as simple as that.", "You can't force people to connect with you by grinding you skills up video game style. She is simply not interested in your romantically. You don't need to \"improve.\" Change your mindset and realize that a single date doesn't mean you are guaranteed a relationship as long as you play it well. This is life lol. Her message was VERY respectful.", "Honestly it\u2019s the dating world today sadly most girls don\u2019t want relationships they want to hook up", "Sorry in advance for any clerical or grammar errors as this message was typed by talk to text.\n\nOP it was not nothing you did wrong so don't try to fix anything in yourself. I agree with everyone that said you know at least she was courteous and she told you instead of dragging this on or ghosting you or anything like that.\n\nNow with that said I don't know her age but just in my personal dating experience and I've often been a hit with the ladies if she was under the age of 27 it was a good chance that she didn't want nice respectable men until women mature oftentimes they're into the whole bad boy thing. Once they have gotten out of this phase and they're tired of getting their heart broken because well that's what bad boys do then they look for somebody more respectable and \"safe\". Now with that being said no man in their relationships should ever be too accommodating because the woman will get bored with you, even though many of them don't like admitting it but if you can have any female best friends that will be candid and honest with you ask them about it.\n\nI started having sex at 14 and I was fortunate enough to have older cousins and uncles who schooled me on how the rules of the game go with younger women so I was able to avoid a lot of heartbreak.  If you're just looking for a fun time, maybe a friends with benefits that you can do things with or if you really like this person you could potentially go the relationship route after a while but don't think about it up front. Until women mature they honestly just want to have some fun and they see safe guys as not really fun. Even though you guys may enjoy each other's company for whatever reason that is not what they're looking for. It's sad, but I had a never-ending Supply of new women to hook up with when I was kind of an a- hole with them. Slightly rude not nasty or belligerent just not really caring and it never ceased to amaze me that the more I acted as if I didn't care the more they went out of their ways to try to impress me or when my attention things like that. They all knew that I was sleeping with and dating several women at a time and none of them cared as they all competed to be the \"one\" to win my affection and to make me settle down. \n\nNow please do not think that this is every single woman because it's not there are a few rare ones who look for guys like you when they're in their early twenties and not into the party/club lifestyle. But if she is a party girl or she goes to the clubs with her girlfriends then it's a 99% chance that she is one of those that wants the bad boy right now so if you're really find someone attractive and you just want to have \"adult fun\" treat all interactions with her like someone that you kind of like but not really and you're not really pressed to be around and she will trip over her own feet trying to get your attention. Just when you show her attention don't show too much as the minute with the young party girl type that you seem too interested or two invested in her she will kick you to the curb. Because to them it comes off as clingy and most of them are running from serious relationships with guys they know will be there for them, then they Circle back around when they get close to 30 and ready to settle down and have kids. It's not fair but it is the way things are currently.\n\n Much luck to you OP", "Top rule of engagement for dating\u2026 if they\u2019re not into you, NEVER try harder. You can\u2019t make anyone feel something that isn\u2019t there, and if you try, then the person will push further from you, you\u2019ll embarrass yourself, and you\u2019ll end up in the \u201cfriend zone\u201d camp where \u201cnice guys\u201d go to die (and complain incessantly about it even though they did it to themselves). It ends up as a repeating cycle of self fulfilling prophecies if you don\u2019t set boundaries and standards for what you want. Going after a woman who doesn\u2019t want you is a sure fire way to get rejected and to make yourself look like you\u2019re desperate to be with just anyone who will fill the empty space next to you.\n\n\nThe problem with guys who think they\u2019re being nice end up doing so much regardless of a set boundary that they begin to build expectations for reciprocation then blame it on their object of desire. Don\u2019t do that to yourself. Pick yourself up & move on. You don\u2019t WANT to be with someone who feels forced into romance with you in reality. Right now, you see the compatibility from YOUR perspective. If it\u2019s not mutual, it\u2019s not a good fit for YOU. Think of what YOU want and need in a relationship. Up front desire and reciprocal emotion should be high on that list.\n\nWhen you set your standards for not accepting less, you\u2019re showing how much you value yourself, and people will recognize that and respect you more. Women will be much more attracted to you as well. Self contained men make women feel safe.", "Probably unpopular take: you may have a Hollywood view of dating. I had this problem too. What you view as being a gentleman comes across manipulative and \u201cnice guy-ey\u201d. You are there to date these women, which means it will be a very intimate relationship. Women have their guard up for manipulators, and when you seem nice for no reason or too interested in them for no reason , you are viewed as a chameleon. Which is fair. I NEVER pushed back on women because I wanted to woo them, there was no impotence on them to woo me back. Which is unattractive. \n\nI only had any modicum of luck when I went out for fun, not for marriage. I took the pressure off it, encouraged not putting a label on things, and kept it casual. Think of \u201crent with option to buy\u201d. It kept me mysterious but also not desperate. Then, worst case scenario you get more experience with women in a casual manner so it\u2019s less stressful. Best case scenario you actually get to know these people, and you fall in love on your own terms. Too many guys go into it trying to get the woman to fall in love with them, and don\u2019t worry about who the person is. It creates a lot of pressure and is dishonest. \n\nIm making a lot of assumptions here, and it may be off base and you\u2019re usually a stud with the ladies. But as a guy that had a hard time getting any action from women, it wasn\u2019t until I took the pressure off it that I started actually having fun and actually felt like I had control over my own autonomy, and I wasn\u2019t just ready to go with whoever was willing.", "She enjoys your company and considers you to be a decent human being which is why she messaged you, highlighted some of your good qualities and explained why you don\u2019t have a future together.

She asked me if it was okay and basically I stewed on it silently for 40 mins in traffic (I was angry) until we got near my place where I pulled into a car park and told her no it wasn\u2019t okay and it\u2019s disrespectful to even ask me something like that.

Some people are genuinely bad at understanding social situations.  I wouldn't call them \"dumb\" but their social and relational iq is low.

Before you act, you're supposed to consider how you'd feel if someone did the same thing to you.

That says a lot about her social iq\n\n>she can have coffee with whomever she wants without asking permission----it's coffee---she owes you fidelity not total control over who she spends platonic time with.\n\nI'd argue that in a relationship, you owe your partner not only fidelity but the appearance of fidelity. That is, don't break my trust and don't do things that make you look untrustworthy. Spending unaccounted platonic time with a guy who is obviously trying to hook up with you isn't cheating. However, it could make you look like a cheater, and it's not fair to your partner. That's why she brought it up to her partner to begin with. Sure, she can have coffee with whoever she wants, but if she had coffee with this guy without telling the partner beforehand, it would make her look like a cheater.\n\n>So she did the right thing, asked for permission, and you're still mad at her.\n\n>Her only crime here as far as I can tell is caring about a past hookup as a human being.\n\nThis is some gaslighty stuff right here.

If it's a \"I just got out of a long term relationship.\" it's a no. If it's a \"I want to focus on my studies right now.\" It's a no. Notice how when a girl gives that excuse, but the guy she actually likes comes along and asks her out only a couple days later? Yeah. She lied. She wanted a relationship, just not with you. If a girl likes you and you ask her out and she actually likes you back, she will ALWAYS say yes. There is no excuse that will stop her saying yes.

I (m30+) was in a relationship for quite some time and treated all women with kindness and respect because I was not looking for anything serious besides my girlfriend. Things ended a few months ago and I started dating again. At first I was friendzoned by the first two girls, but then I changed a few little things and I want to share it with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNumber 1: You have to be at least ***a little bit attractive.*** Start working out a little bit, volunteer in a social project and help young people or kids (you will become a nicer human being) and start reading literature. Maybe changer your style in clothing so you look like a bombshell.\n\nNumber 2: Since you get friendzoned a lot, ***HAVE FEMALE FRIENDS!*** If a girl friendzoned you a long. time ago and you still get out great, treat her as a friend. Talk to her about your dating experiences and ask her to give you advice. I think the first part of not being friendzoned is to REALLY have female friends you like. In the future you can tell every girl wanting to friendzone you: \"Sorry, I really got some good female friends, I don't need additional female friends.\" ***For me it worked like a magic spell. And remember: this female friends you have now will be the last female friends that you have, because you won't be making friends anymore.***\n\nNumber 3: You should be ***VERY CLEAR*** about what you want in online dating. You should ask before meeting each other: What are you looking for? One girl told me: I am cold and want to cuddle, so this was a clear sign is not just interested in being \"friends\". If you want ONS, not many girls are interested in it since they can have it whenever they want. For me I was serious and said: \"I just finished a relationship and I am not looking for a new one right away but I love exploring my sexuality with someone that is cool.\" It worked a lot on lots of women.\n\nNumber 4: You should complement her on something that YOU see in her and you truely mean. I love high cheek bones and whenever I see high cheek bones I tell the girls how incredibly sexy they are. They love it. Don't complement them on something EVERYONE sees.\n\nNumber 5: Sooner or later you should talk about sexuality. Please make sure that the other person is not traumatized and that they feel in a safe spot, not in the middle of a park at night. Just drop some hints about your first time having sex. If you are a virgin, I am not sure if I would drop it at that time, maybe you can tell about when you were sleeping at a friends place and heard the parents making love or something. Talk really freely about what you like and look how they react. If they don't wanna talk about it, don't force it.\n\nNumber 6: Challenge them and tell them some of your opinions that are maybe a little critical (not racism or holocaust denial or homophobia of course). For me it was that she said she wants trigger warnings in tv shows and I was like no, I think it is sometimes good to confront yourself with your fear. Or I gave her a nickname that she found really stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNumber 7: Also DEMAND some stuff in a nice way. When she asks you to go to the climbing hall, you can agree but tell her that you want to go to a place near your area because you don't want to drive so far. If she wants you to eat at a sushi bar, tell her you can do that but you want to have a beer in the park afterwards because you feel like being outside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNumber 8: The last one is an experiment and you should only do it if you REALLY feel like it. If you LIKE a girl, but don't feel attracted to her, tell her you can hang out some time as friends but you are looking for something else but still like her a lot. Do it in a way you respect her and only do it if you mean it like it. I had a date with a very attractive women that wasn't my type and I told her I can only imagine being friends and she was really really really astonished and asked me what was wrong and I just told her that I don't feel the vibe with her but we can do sport together or hang out if she does not mind. It really helped me understanding the dynamics of the whole friendzoning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n9: sexuality: If you have sex with a women, don't force it and make it a pleasureful experience for both of you. I love women in every aspect and I try to be a vessel of pure joy for them. Make them a coffee in the morning and cuddle, but do as you wish, I love it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR;\n\n1: be attractive (body, humour, character)\n\n2: have female friends that you don't desire sexually and be a GOOD FRIEND. If someone offers you to \"be friends\" tell them you got awesome female friends and are not interested but wish them good luck in life.\n\n3: be clear about what you want.\n\n4: complement her on something you mean, be truthful and direc.t\n\n5: talk about sexuality but respect borders.\n\n6: show your character and stuff that you think even if she does not find it awesome, just be able to find arguments for your position.\n\n7: you don't owe anything, you should have an awesome time as well and she should feel that you could also hang out with your friends but you chose her and you expect the same from her.\n\n8: try to understand the friendzoning process from your side.\n\n9: offer them something if you sleep with them, make them cum and make them feel wonderful.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLEASE HELP ME MAKE THIS EVEN BETTER!

I do think it is socially acceptable. I think the media along with older generations have overemphasized how much such a thing matters or how much people care about it. No one really cares what you're doing in your own relationship. Everyone is too caught up in their own lives for it to matter and chances are the age gap wouldn't even come up except with friends and family, and again even if it did, I don't think anyone cares enough. Plus less and less people are believing in these norms as time goes on. If my 26 year old male friend told me they were dating a 34 year old woman, it wouldn't really strike me as odd and I don't think I'd even comment on it unless there was a clear gap in maturity, lifestyle, or life goals (for example, someone who is 34 may be thinking about kids before the person who is 26 had planned to have children in their life, in which case that may be an issue). Additionally, it is becoming so hard to find partners with whom one is compatible and partnerships that are sustainable. If you've found such a partner and relationship, it's worthwhile to hold onto it than to be concerned over what other people/society think of it. You wouldn't get married, or have children with, or grow old with society; you'd (if those are things you want, I don't want to be presumptuous) do those things with your partner and her alone. It's better to have a partner that you think could build a sustainable future with than one that society wouldn't have an issue with but with whom you may. Presume a coworker or someone did think it was odd. Then what? Why does their opinion hold merit for what you do in your own life when it's not hurting anyone? Other people sticking their noses where it doesn't belong shouldn't dictate what you do with your life and shouldn't put your potential joy with this woman at risk.", "After a certain age, bigger age gaps start to matter less and less.

Our relationship isn\u2019t effortless but when it comes to the work it takes to maintain and advance our relationship, I\u2019ve never felt like I didn\u2019t want to do any of it. Dates, nights out, trips, heavy conversations, have all felt right, necessary, and relatively easy to do. We\u2019re always proving to each other that we\u2019re on the same page.\n\nWe\u2019re planning a wedding next year and just finalizing our home purchase and it\u2019s all been a lot of work, but it\u2019s work I want to do.", "To me love is one of those things where the harder or the more you chase it, the more it eludes you. When you really click with someone or vibe with someone, it *feels* or seems effortless even if it truly is not without effort (everybody is putting on makeup and/or showering and whatnot before meeting the other person, presumably \ud83e\udd23). When two people 'harmonize' naturally it's not because either of them are bending over backwards or working hard. It just flows somehow.\n\n> Issue is I feel like that might be a flash in the pan in my dating life - or at least there\u2019s no guarantees that I\u2019ll connect with anyone on that level, however I can\u2019t really justify \u2018settling\u2019 for anything less than that in a long term relationship because then I\u2019ll always be haunted by the thought that there was probably someone who I\u2019m more compatible with around the corner. And I don\u2019t want to deprive myself of opportunities to meet great people by setting such a high bar.\n\nFOMO is usually toxic and destructive and I would say that's the case here as well. At a certain point it doesn't make a lot of sense to hold out for a phantom or a thing/person that doesn't exist and sometimes when people are in relationships that FOMO feeling is actually an expression of unhappiness with their current/partner relationship. In that case, FOMO is pretty misleading because instead of confronting hard truths directly (\"this relationship sucks, I'm unhappy\") people get hung up on that mythical perfect unicorn that's out there, somewhere, waiting to be found, when really what they should be doing is finding ways to communicate how they feel with their current partner and seeing what, if anything, can be worked out, possibly through couples counseling.\n\nIf you're tired of jumping through flaming hoops, then stop. Take a break from dating and chasing. Learn to be completely happy, content, and fulfilled on your own as a single. Because paradoxically it's people who are single and absolutely thrilled with their existing lives and don't 'need' anyone else who are the most ripe for the best, most fulfilling relationships and it's the people who are absolutely desperate, needy, clingy, unhappy, and miserable because they have a shitload of unmet needs who make the worst partners, get into develop toxic relationships, and make poor partners.", "I feel the term \"effortless\" is an oversimplification.\n\nIt should feel worth your time. It shouldn't feel like a chore, but a labor (at times) of love and value.\n\nNo relationship will be without times of effort requirement, and building a relationship does require energy. It should not, however, feel one-sided. There should be mutual interest driving you both to want to spend time together and learn more about one another.\n\nAs a married woman of almost 12 years who has been in a relationship with their spouse for over 16 years, I remember there being times of effort.\n\nBut it wasn't *making* myself reach out, *struggling* through boredom, or anything like pointless work. It was having tough life plan conversations, because my life plan when we met was NOT what has happened, and was not the same as his. I had to decide if changing what I had planned for myself in life was worth keeping him as my life partner. (Hint: it most definitely was.)\n\nShould it feel \"effortless\"?\n\nNo.\n\nShould it be a burdenous chore?\n\nNo.\n\nIt should feel natural and unforced. \"Effortless\" is a romanticized term for the moments of peace and calm you feel when interacting and being with your person at times of low effort requirement. It's the idea that you don't have to work to focus on them, that you focus intrinsically due to your level of care and connection to them.\n\nThat's how I feel about it, anyway. Hopefully you find someone who you can lose track of time talking to, who makes you feel comfortable, and feels \"effortless.\"\n\nGood luck, friend. \ud83d\udc9b", "soon as you stop looking and foucas on yourself the right one will pop in... stop trying so hard, stop giving a fuck about what other people think, just chase your goals set realistic ones too, ask where you want to be in 5 years then set year 1 goal, if you Wana be a doctor then go med school and enroll you will be able to get there in 5 years and find the study fun or if you Wana be a pilot then go for it 5 years you will be one, if you want to be in the UFC join a gym get good at it enroll for fights, chase your dream not women... when you put women on a pedalstal they will drift away, men need to offer women particular services like safety, shelter, food, babies if you can't offer women those things then work on yourself till you can, girlfriends will only be a distraction from where your heading, I also belive in not wasting your time in a women unless you actually really like her, chase the ones that you consider out of your league then when one does bite on show her a good time but don't be weird just act super cool, don't message her or spam her set dates and stop caring when she's busy you gotta foucas on you, if all is well just propose to the girlfreind early on in the relationship get engaged and if she doesn't want it then you know it wasn't for you, a good woman will support you through your goals as you increase your wealth and reputation. be the hero of your own movie your life is a video game and your the main character, level the fuck up.", "I don't have advice but I have an example for hope:\n\nIn my last relationship, everything felt taxed.

He hated my friends, he especially got upset when I would be gaming with my guy friends.\n\nThe guy I'm dating now is one of my gaming friends and it's so relaxed.

I was dating around for 10 years and none of the men I dated seemed to want anything serious WITH ME for whatever reason (sometimes it\u2019s not even there\u2019s anything wrong with you) it\u2019s just that they wanna sleep around, have traumas, who knows (I\u2019m actually very hot and kind and studied etc). Anyhow, I recently met a serious guy, all mature, very kind and family oriented. He asked me to be his gf (old school and everything) 6 weeks later . We already met each other\u2019s families etc. I am super happy with him.

It\u2019s more of a shift in dynamic. You\u2019re learning to cohabitate your mind and needs with another person and usually at this point is when it starts to sink in. You no longer feel the pressure to be perfect; you\u2019re able to settle into a very organic and fulfilling relationship. \n\nThe effort shows in other ways. Taking time to be vulnerable and show sides of yourself that aren\u2019t always present; acknowledging your partner\u2019s struggles and accepting them.\n\nOf course, this is an example of a balanced, healthy relationship and this may not always be everyone\u2019s experience. Nobody is perfect and there will be ups and downs.

Without the pressure of expectation folks can open up and be fully themselves that\u2019s harder in the beginning of an undefined dynamic. Instead of chasing that feeling with other people, chase it for yourself- how can you be more open, authentic and engaged with the world around you? In many places women put in more of the dating effort so no- I did not- by your first sentence- guess you were a guy. You might be in a place right now where you are more attracted to avoidant people and less attracted to available ones- and to overcome that you need to reprogram a bit and ask deeply what you are looking for.

We talk through our problems while listening to eachother, we live in the same city, we are very committed, and face any issues head on and as a team. Now, our relationship is so easy and effortless. However, I would say we definitely beat the odds and are the exception and not the rule. I will say that good relationships take work though - from both sides.", "I think that most people don't truly mean \"effortless\", and they more mean \"difficult\".

The judgment people get for being sexworkers is insane, and I've had a couple guys completely change how they act towards me and push sex a lot more after I tell them I cam.\n\nBut here's the thing....if you two were already dating and she hadn't told you, plus you only found out because you caught her? I am not sure if she ever was going to tell you. I don't touch anyone else, and I still make sure the guy is 100% okay with what I'm doing before I move on to even thinking about dating. This isn't going to work. She broke your trust and took away your choice of whether you are okay with being in a relationship where she isn't entirely yours. \nLike I said, I understand why, but it doesn't make it right, though.\n\nDon't ghost her.

I'm not saying it's a 1:1 analogy to your situation, but I definitely sympathize with her.\n\nthat being said, I think despite sympathizing with her, it's important for you to acknowledge that she hid this from you. I'd probably ask if it started before or during your relationship, but either way it was an intentional omission. some girls do OF or are on PH but their partners know about it. i would likely worry that if she could keep this a secret from you successfully for X amount of time, what else could she possibly omit or lie to you in the future?\n\nalso, it sounds like you're a great guy for wanting to comfort her and listening out to her, which i think speaks highly of you, but i would be careful as to how much of your current \"acceptance\" of the situation is because you really like her. i just want to caution you because if you end up doing this temporarily out of \"like\" and you guys don't work out in the long run, you could potentially end up resenting yourself.\n\nthat being said, I think this is your personal decision and given your partner's pretty fragile state, whatever you choose---hopefully you'll deliver your decision gently.\n\nlastly: is she unable to get a part time gig outside of school that doesn't involve sexual favors for money that would help alleviate her financial situation? life isn't easy for a lot of people, but she doesn't sound like she's a very enthusiastic sex worker and i'm pretty worried for her and her future. this could easily derail... but that being said, you do not need to think you're responsible for her burden and future. but i would probably connect her with a resource that could help her if its this bad. like... does she fear what her parents are gonna say, or are they unable to help her financially?\n\nif you find out she's lying and she actually is pretty ok with this work ... well then i would suggest leaving. that's not a partner you want in the long run.", "At this point it all boils down to whether you can date her knowing what she has/is doing.

It's totally forgiveable dishonesty imo. So it's up to you on that front. However dating any kind of SW isn't for everyone. It can be complex and does produce hard to manage feelings frequently especially in a new relationship. Consider whether you can forgive her. Consider if dating a SW is for you.

Maybe people are less scandalized there.\n\nYou are more likely to catch an STI from a cheater than a SW, because their health and livelihood relies on safe sex and frequent testing.

Before you inevitable, bounce from this relationship.", "I think this is a clear case of: She belongs to the streets! And here is why:\n\nHer \"job\" does not necessarily matter. What does matter is her lying to you, mate. She had to be honest from the start, let alone for medical reasons. She has a huge responsibility here but quite obviously does not give a damn about whether she might bring home STDs or what not. Again, that does not necessarily have to do with her \"job\", cause if she would bang myriad guys without getting paid, she still needs to be up front about that.\n\nThat said: People who lie and deceive just like she does reveal their true character. They're the type of people who are also prone to keeping other things from you. I mean let's be 100% clear here: Unless she happens to be the victim of some trafficking or whatever, she herself **decided** to bang random dudes for money. So however you twist and turn it: Because she made that decision, she should - regardless of the reactions she might get - be up front. I mean I am a certified counselor, running my own business and I hold a degree in sociology, so I can't just go out telling people that I am a jet pilot or a submarine captain if I am not, right? Which brings us right to this:\n\n\"She broke down saying how it was just a temporary thing, and started listing the many reasons she got into this. And that she\u2019s not gonna do this forever.\"\n\nAlright, what other reason than money did she mention? Because yet again: Unless she is an actual victim of human trafficking and forced prostitution, she can cry you as many rivers as she'd like. Actually I find it really disgusting when free, autonomous women act as if they're in the same miserable condition as actual victims of sex slave trade, so to speak. Let's spit right in the face of those women by putting yourself in juxtaposition with them when you, most likely, are just in for the easy and quick money. The only other scenario I can imagine is some woman having a fetish in regards to prostituting herself, but I guess that's one hell of an exception to the rule, right?\n\nHate me if you must, but to me, this boils down to that BS you hear from a lot of those stereotypical OnlyFans type of girls who sell their body online (and sometimes IRL to punters) and then start crying if they got to deal with the consequences of their own choices in life.\n\nAnd don't listen to people giving you the BS like: \"You're a sexist!\" or \"You should be a little more sex positive!\" No man, you stick to your values. If you are the type of guy who, like me, wants to be in exclusive, monogamous relationships with loyal and committed women, stand your ground. That alone does not make you a sexist, nor does it mean you have to think of prostitutes as lesser people. They aren't, and sex work is fine for as long as it is voluntarily and for as long as the respective sex worker is an honest and respectful person him/herself. Still that does not mean that they immediately have the privilege to expect you to be with them if you do not want to. It is as simple as that.\n\nSo if you have an issue with that, tell her. Cause what you are doing now, OP, is wrong in its very own regard. Ghosting someone never did any good - actually I find ghosting people almost as pathetic as liars. Both is weak and quite honestly immature and disrespectful. If you can't be with this woman due to her selling her body to other men, she deserves to hear exactly that so there's closure.", "People of reddit, take this how you will. I've had mates that have ended up in very serious and still going strong relationships that have started with a girl who was prostituting.\n\nIt took a while. Both had problems.. drugs on both sides one was sucking and fucking for cash while the other was a gambling d3generate but in the long short term the made it work and both ended up better people.\n\nIf you like her, give her a chance BUT ONLY if you see she has a good heart. Otherwise, kick her ass to the curb and move on", "Your post is short. I don't know you nor this girl. A lot of people here are making definitive statements as though they absolutely know the situation, but I don't think anyone does. I don't think *you* do, really.\n\nThat said, it doesn't sound like it was a dealbreaker for you. Now, let's be clear: a lot of people are talking about how she \"hid it from you, that's dishonest,\" but I think that's specious at best. Let's be real--look at how everyone is reacting. They're so *repulsed*. I'm sure she feels the same.\n\nIt's pretty easy to imagine a girl who met a guy she likes, but has no means of supporting herself aside the way that she has been--as a pay-per-booty call. Why she, and so many others like her, wouldn't just resort to camming is my best guess, because wtf. Being paid for just touching yourself on webcam is awesomely lucrative, and you don't have to deal with anyone at all. But, of course, logistically speaking, she can do this and take it to her grave, so to speak (since you already know about it now), and forget it ever happened. I mean, thats *technically* possible, anyway. Camming? Lol, literally anyone and everyone who watches porn, male or female, which is like, 90% of everyone, will have fapped to you by the time you meet them. It would be impossible to, say, meet a guy like you.\n\nYou need to sit down with her and have a frank conversation about it. And, be reasonable! Don't see it from some, \"but, I should own your body, wtf,\" perspective. And, don't be all \"but, you **lied**\" defensive. Really hear her out, and do some soul searching, and see whether you can live with what she's done. Then, see whether you guys can find a way forward together. If not, fuggetit. If so, then you'll probably have a decent enough relationship for a year or two, because you guys are pretty young and those relationships never last anyway, so you might as well enjoy them for what they are. I mean, sure, *some* people that age stay together, but they're the minority.", "I\u2019m a little bit split on this one. On one hand, I can totally understand why she\u2019d be more than hesitant to open up about this - especially given the majority of reactions even just on here. Also, I do think it\u2019s possible to be safe about sw by getting tested often and using condoms. (While I don\u2019t know how safe she was, it is odd to me that seemingly everyone here assumes she probably has multiple STIs.)\n\nHowever, she absolutely shouldn\u2019t have hidden this from you for months. Transparency and communication is key for any relationship - doubly so when it comes to one with more potential health risks (and isn\u2019t fully traditionally monogamous). I could understand waiting maybe a month or until y\u2019all were going to get intimate for the first time (whichever first), but hiding it for months is a selfish choice.\n\nI can\u2019t say what you should do because that is entirely up to you and how you feel about the situation. I\u2019m sure you feel hurt by her actions, and that is completely valid and justified! You don\u2019t have to take her back if you don\u2019t want to. But if this is something you can get past and see the relationship as still worth one more shot, I would have a loooong and serious talk with her about transparency and expectations regarding all this.", "Women like this are less likely to be faithful and commit to long lasting relationships. The odds are not n your favor at all in this situation. She was going to give old men blow jobs then come kiss you while lying to you about it.

Otherwise, if it's just casual then it's sorta subjective in terms of how you see this. If you think she crossed a boundary that is not acceptable for you then it may be best to end this while you're still ahead.\n\nOtherwise, you can always just proceed based on your best judgement of the situation.", "Yo job or not that's betrayal. You can be as understanding as you want, and obviously I wouldnt shame her sex working if I were you, but shes been doing god knows what with however many then coming back to you.\n\nShe ain't ready for a relationship.", "I had something similar happen to me. It was nearly 18 months in when I found out she was escorting.  Sugar babies, evidently all of the girls in the frats and sororities at college when she joined are doing it, they showed her, etc.   \n\n\nShe was not forthcoming with details once discovered.  And I learned that's because the hole goes deep.  Also, she might have legitimately had trouble recalling details, which seemed liked it came because she had both normalized the activity, but also there did seem to be some repression going on under the surface.   \n\n\nI was blindsided.  I was 36, she was 19, I was on the rebound, it was supposed to be just that. But I was impressed, she was a foster kid, graduated HS at 16, in college on her own at 17, smart. Her story was a lot like mine except I was at the beach hanging out with stoner surfers all day at 17 and she was in college, so I had a lot of respect for that.  She was over the top for me, left hand-written cards in my luggage every time I traveled for work (frequently), real nice meaningful notes, I'd never seen anything like it.  Then she started calling herself my gf and I would joke it away, brush it off, but I never really agreed or would pronounce it, but she just became my girlfriend.  She was the one that made it happen, came around all the time, etc.   \n\n\nWell, she was an escort, and cheated the whole time. Not just for money, but any time there was a suspicious night or activity - e.g. going out with friends to an art show, whatever - upon circling back, there was something involving a guy there.  A TON of pics and videos sold.  Just a ton, anytime she needed cash she'd take to social media.    \n\n\nNearly every fight we had, she went and fucked someone else.  Would just start a new Tinder account and meet up with someone.    \n\n\nI also found out that it was a way of her filling a void, of not being lonely.  She didn't have many girlfriends, and the primary friends she had were also escorting.  So every time I would go out of town - again frequently - she'd go out.  We both live on the west coast, my travel was mainly to the east coast at that time, so 11pm or midnight shed FaceTime me goodnight, and a half hour later she'd be going out.   \n\n\nI couldn't handle it, in the end.  The girl before her was someone I really liked (30), and I found out after 5 months that she was living with her bf and I might've been some kink in their relationship for her to go home to after.  I still don't know the full story.   After her I went and go with my best friend for years (46), who I don't want to get into details on but she betrayed me worse than either the 30 year old or the 21 year old (21 when I found out she was escorting, 19 when we got together).   \n\n\nEven if she hadn't happened in the middle of a shit sandwich, the quickness, ease and comfort with which she lied were all so prevalent that the relationship itself was irreparable.  It sounds like your gf is showing more remorse, but is she?  When was she ever going to tell you?  From her perspective, it only gets harder to tell you the more time goes on.  And she wouldn't share with you how many, or when, so I'm guessing the truth is uglier than she wants you to know.   \n\n\nIf I had to do it over, I wouldn't have talked about it in the moment   I would've given her a list of reasonable questions that I needed answers to in order to consider continuing on in any kind of a relationship.  I would've given her space and time to answer, or to choose to not answer.  I wouldn't have expended all the energy that I did, the anger, confusion, hurt, jealousy, etc., just wasn't worth it.  I doubt it would've made a difference, we also had a more dramatic age gap than you have, but it was the honesty that I needed to trust again - full, unadulterated honesty and remorse - and that was never going to come.   \n\n\nI'd just say you need to ask yourself if you can live with it.  It's a betrayal of great magnitude.  It's something that you will remember and account for in the future, when a situation calls for your grace, trust, and patience with her.  Will you have it, will you be able to have it, will you be able to work through the next fight, or the next one, or the one after that?  What is it that will make you trust her completely and fully again?    \n\n\nAnd then tell her what you need and what it's for.  Come from a place of repair and not a place of wanting to know for the sake of wanting to know.  Only ask her to share what you need to know to make things better again for you.   \n\n\nI have my guesses as to how this will work out.  But anything is possible, and without having all the details from both sides, I don't even want to speculate on record.  I can only say, I'm really sorry this happened to you, it's hurtful beyond measure, and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.   \n\n\nGood luck man.   \n\n\nAM", "I don\u2019t see the problem with escorting (as long as she\u2019s getting regular STD tests) but where I would draw the line is dishonesty tbh..

My personal issues come in wheb people use this specific instance as a commonality or that \"no man will want to date sex workers.\" And to that, I ask, why? Strippers while dancers are doing things specifically provocatively and for a sexual rise. People date strippers all the time who are not involved in that industry, yet they are still technically sex workers. Porn actors can also have healthy relationships, but it's all based on communication and transparency.\n\n If someone doesn't want to be in a relationship with a sex worker, that's fine. But to demonize them because of it is gross. Especially if in any specific case they have done nothing wrong. In this specific instance, she did not disclose it and put his health at risk. That is on her, but this specific situation seems to bring out the people who want to generalize and say no man ever would date this woman because she is an escort.

I say those things to say it's absolutely OK to have the oreference and being unable to reconcile someone being a prostitute in the past, or a porn star, etc. However... it's also true that the people(especially women) who have had a history of such work are often dehumanized for it.\n\n The reason this kind of sticks with me is because again... country boy who likes country things.

But yet seem to overlook that generally we agree on many things. While no one should catch hate for having a preference, to then hide behind that preference as a way to perpetuate current social norms that have added to stigmatize a group is the problem. Now, I am NOT saying you are hiding behind preference as an individual. But if you look at these comments, you can see how this systemic outlook comes out. \n\nBy all means, don't go out with a prostitute or a porn star or an Only-Fans model if you don't want to.

Nothing could ever divide them except death.\nSorry for the book but it has very little to do with what is trendy and more to do with loyalty and commitment.

When it comes to talking about sex, I'd rather keep that between us and keep the conversation constructive and caring.  \n\n\nAs for what I want in a woman, I want someone I can talk to, have fun with, ask advice from, bounce ideas off of, care for, be cared by and trust in all the ways that matter.

I'm trying to make myself worthy of the person I want to be with (whoever she is) and I'd continue to strive to be worthy still even years into a relationship.   \nI take the term \"My other half\" kinda seriously.

I don't mind love handles and some fat, but there is a limit to what i find attractive. \n\u2022 not too skinny. I do like skinny girls better than overweight girls, but again, there's a limit to what i find attractive. I have met girls that believe themselves to be too overweight, where i think of them as too skinny (these girls didn't have a eating disorder. At least not that I knew of, but nothing suggested it) \n\u2022 i don't care about height, any height is good with me. Both really short and really tall girls have their respective attractive traits. \n\u2022 i do like a good set of tits. Not too small and not too big, but the range of size is quite wide. Not too saggy either, but again, long range. As long as shes literally not as flat as a board, they're not vulgarly big, and they don't touch the bellybutton when standing, they're probably fine. \n\u2022 more or less the same thing goes with ass. Not too big, not too small, and preferably a nice shape is good, but again wide range. \n\u2022 some well proportioned facial features with feminine aesthetics. \n\u2022 i like long hair. I have found a few short haired girls i find attractive, but in general, i vastly prefer long hair. \n\u2022 if i have to choose a preferred hair color, i would go with redheads, but any hair color is beautiful. \n\u2022 i like a more natural makeup look. I don't like the extremely artificial look with alot of makeup, which otherwise seems to be gaining popularity in society. A well made party/model look is great on occasion, but as a everyday thing, i like a more modest made makeup look. \n\u2022 i really don't like the Botox/filler look, where everything looks so unnatural and the skin on the lips look so stressed because of the tension from all that filler.\n\u2022 i like a girl that can dress for the occasion. A girl that can dress for meeting the parents one day, a professional dinner the next, a party one night, sexy time another night, and sloppy when chilling on the couch. \n\nPersonality traits:\n\u2022 someone that can stand me and help me when I'm down. \n\u2022 someone relatively grounded and able to see things objectively. \n\u2022 someone not too dumb. \n\u2022 someone that have at least a little confidence. \n\u2022 someone that likes my bad sense of humor\n\u2022 someone that can tease me a little and likes me teasing back.

It's perfectly fine to be mad at me for something, but come and talk with me about it when you're ready, instead of the silent treatment. That's a big time relationship killer for me. I can't stand it at all. \n\u2022 someone that is relatively independent, meaning someone that is capable of doing what they want without being dependent on me being there all the time. I love helping my girl with whatever she needs and i love spending time with my girl, but i also need to do my own things and see my own friends. Even though i love spending time together, whether it's hobbies, getogethers with friends or what not, it can be too much if it's all the time. I need just a little space. \n\u2022 someone that has opinions of at least some topics that she cares about.\n\u2022 someone that i can talk with.\n\nI don't look for a girl that fills ALL the criteria above.

Instead, you should respond to my latest comment for the sake of clear discussion.\n\nI didn\u2019t say anything about monogamy. You introduced monogamy. I said that there is selective pressure which makes men prefer women who can guarantee the paternity of their offspring, which is true. In fact *it cannot not be true* by virtue of how the process of evolution functions. OP asked what men find attractive. I answered. Are you a man? I doubt it because you wouldn\u2019t bat an eye at my statements if you were, because you would know it\u2019s validity as truth. \n\nPolygamy in our evolutionary past was slowly genetically competed-out by pair-bonding based social structures long before humans were an organized species in the form of civilization. \n\nModern polygamy in human populations is observed most commonly as *a cultural and religious artifact,* rather than as an ecological norm. Indeed, there used to be evolutionary theories suggesting that females would seek \u201cmore masculine mates\u201d to induce pregnancy but would opt for \u201ca caregiver mate\u201d once the child had been born. This was partially based on research that indicates women find men with more physical prowess and cues of conventional masculinity attractive during period of ovulation, but men with \u201csofter features\u201d more attractive outside of her fertility window. That said, those theories have been criticized in recent times. \n\nRegarding pair bonding (specifically related to the production and effect of oxytocin, vasopressin, and dopamine), the sociological and neurological research is absolutely clear, with no doubt, that increasing the number of sexual partners for *both* sexes results in reduced pair bonding potential, and other measures of lifestyle satisfaction (including marital satisfaction). That said, there are genetic influences which have a strong effect on these outcomes as well. \n\nSure, dating others is a great opportunity to build up relationship skills. However, it does not negate the effects of reduced pair bonding and is unrelated to effects on pair-bonding. Moreover, one can have plenty of sexual partners and preserve negative social skills. Having relationships can both nurture good beliefs and habits about relationships but also preserve and reinforce harmful ones. \n\nIf you want subjectivity, my first girlfriend and I had a lovely relationship for 3 years, and we both took each other\u2019s virginity. Indeed, we still care about each other and communicate well almost ten years later. What was important was being conscientious of our faults, having the will to change for the better (for ourselves and the sake of being a better partner), and understanding what we valued in each other and unconditionally giving those things to each other out of love. \n\nAnd at the end you\u2019re somehow conflating biological theory with misogyny. And that exposes the real issue here\u2014you don\u2019t want to accept the truth of evolutionary theory because you *don\u2019t like the way it makes you feel*. That\u2019s called an *argument by consequence*, which is a logical fallacy, and which immediately discredits your arguments. You wouldn\u2019t use another logical fallacy, \u201cthe red herring\u201d of conflating science with hate towards women, if that weren\u2019t true. \n\nAnd then you make a personal attack at the end for good measure, but that\u2019s another logical fallacy which only digs you deeper into a hole of wrongness (and rudeness!).", "Ummm the purpose of my input is to support or advance if the idea is good, and to challenge if the idea is not good and the result of the decision will affect me.

I know sex truly isn't a big deal, I've never had it, but I feel like it'd be a better experience if I can have an actual relationship with a guy and feel safe in his presence.\n\nMy friend keeps telling me that my preference is gonna forever make dating hard for me since most people want hookups and sex quickly, which feels too scary and too much for me tbh. \n\nI recently got rejected by this guy I met on Bumble year ago but never went out with til recently due to life and me being busy with school.

NO HOOKUPS SWIPE LEFT IF THATS WHAT YOU WANT is a turn off.\n\nBy and large, boys and girls are different when it comes to the different states of dating and mating. There isn't really a big difference when it comes to how much guys and girls like intimacy, but there is a big difference concerning the contexts and conditions under which men and women are usually ready and eager to have sex. \n\nWomen usually must feel safer than men to even consider being intimate. They crave an emotional connection very often. They want to feel protected, understood, valued, liked and adored and taken care of in the sense that a man invests. Sex would come after those conditions are met. \n\nFor most men, it is not like that. \n\nFor most men it isn't really possible to open up and fully experience the nonsexual components of getting to know a woman in a romantic context for as long as that desire for her looms at the forefront of their brains. For men, the deeper emotional connection, the 'relationship' comes after they quenched that thirst. That doesn't man that a guy cannot enjoy your company or doesnt like you and enjoy the emotional aspects while desiring you. The analogy is flawed, but it's a bit like trying to tell a very hungry person amidst one of the tastiest and largest buffets to not be so focused on all the different dishes. To be more chill and to just engage in the conversation and to reprimand him that he consistently peeks at all the food and wants to touch and eat the food. \n\nYou could say that initially, most guys senses are overloaded with the desire for a woman. Doesn't mean they are zombies and single minded and cannot control their urges. It's not about that. But it is a powerful motivation and they cannot help but to be focused on that. It's not like that for all men. I think it might be better for you and easier to find men that are more like you that don't want to connect with women or approach them because of strong sexual attraction. \n\nFor a most guys, when they read something like that, no hookups, it's as if they are told that the very reason why they even want to interact with a woman (sexual attraction) is taken away, is not an option and, not only that, the woman appears to be telling them in an aggressive way (capital letters) that they should not be a man or feel like a man.\n\nMen are also not like women when it comes to the different motivations to interact with the other sex. Women, by and large, are much more likely to enjoy interacting with a variety of men, even establishing deeper friendships with them, without being sexually attracted on any level. \n\nMost men are not like that. 8,5 out of 10 good male friends secretly or not so secretly want to have sex with their female friends or at least wouldn't mind that it happened. Or they have an actual crush on the girl. The overriding motivation to invest more into a girl than a simple hi and bye is sexual attraction. That's what they're concerned with and focused on first and foremost.\n\nMost guys will think 'sooo.....no sex at all? Or very very late? What does that mean? 10 date? 5 months? A year? She's pretty and I'd really like to sleep with her but that seems completely off the table and she seems to be aggressive about it as well with all that NOHOOKUPS line. Moreoever, she prolly had a bunch of bad experiences and is super on guard and \u00fcber careful....this isn't worth my time'.\n\nThe equivalent to such a line would be a man writing in capital letters on his profile:\n\n'IF YOU DONT WANNA SMASH ON FIRST OR SECOND DATE DONT WASTE MY TIME I DONT WANNA BE YOUR FRIEND I DONT WANNA BE IN YOUR FRIENDZONE I DONT WANT TO BE YOUR SHOULDER TO CRY ON I DONT HAVE TIME TO LISTEN TO YOUR BORING STORIES I FIRST NEED TO GET WHAT I WANT AND THEN I MIGHT CONSIDER GIVING YOU WHAT YOU WANT'.\n\nBelieve me, the vast majority of women would be turned off by a guy and a statement like that. \n\nThat's not the way to do it. \n\nI think it would be better to go into forums or events or whatever with other ppl like you. Ppl that are not really interested in sex or aren't motivated by sexual attraction, at least not in the initial phase and dont want that for possibly months or even longer. \n\nBecause, Im telling you, it will be a major turnoff for most guys, as that \\[sex\\] and the potential for sex is the overriding motivation for most men to even interact with a woman. It's the overriding motivation for those guys that only want sex but (surprise surprise) it is also the overriding motivation for those guys that are very attracted to a girl and want to make her their gf. They still really want sex with her and most guys would (if they could) have sex with her very soon. As soon as possible basically. \n\nFor guys to be able to relax enough and not be consumed by raging hormones, they have to first quench that thirst. Also, guys wanna know if a woman really desires them. Most guys know that girls can often just want companionship, male friends, somebody that listens to them etc. etc. Girls will actively seek such male companionship.\n\nFor a woman to truly understand if a man wants her for more than sex she will have to observe if he stays and still invests a lot after sex. If he commits to her after sex. For a man, the only way to see if a woman actually wants him as a man, desires him and is really attracted to him....is if the woman sleeps with him. \n\nWithout that, most guys cannot be sure if a woman really wants him or possibly simply uses him emotionally. As entertainment, as a shoulder to cry on. Or just wants a friend cause she feels lonely. \n\nBy making such statements and shouting 'NOHOOKUPS' into the world, you're basically attacking that which is the prime motivator for men to even interact with women. At least in the initial phase. Women that scream such things sound aggressive, traumatized, with tons of baggage, anti male, anti sex.\n\nIm not saying you are like that. But, im telling you, no man that isnt desperate would want to deal with somebody who presents themselves like that. \n\nNot telling you that to pull you down. But, do not communicate like that and listen....do not use dating apps. You need to find spaces where men that are more like you are. Might take some time, but the average man, most more or less 'normal' guys without that/your preference or disposition will not understand, will feel attacked and will feel that they cannot get that from you which they (initially) primarily want. As I said, that is the mother of all turnoffs. You wont attract good guys like that but will instead turn most guys off instantly.", "Thank you for being real with me, I truly appreciate it.

It's harder however to reconcile this with being able to commit to three simultaneous sexual relationships, where at least one clearly has more emotional exposure than just a fwbs scenario. \n\nI have to wonder what he is telling these other women, and whether they are also blindly hoping that he will change and see that they are his future based on his reactions. I'm not saying that is what's going on, but it has to be a possibility. Without wanting to sound mean or judgemental,  based on personal knowledge of human nature, I'd think it is surely more likely than the scenario he presents where is so damaged he cannot help but treat you the way he currently does.\n\nI absolutely feel for you, and I'd in no way pretend to have all the answers, but it feels as though you are asking for a solution which you know can't exist. One where you retain some pride in yourself, retain a sense of self-worth and value, but where you are left not only permanently hanging on wanting exclusivity and commitment,  but also being actively hurt by the knowledge he is intimate with other people. I don't know how you achieve that without fundamentally changing who you are - your beliefs and values.

Can you look yourself in the eye and honestly say that you don't feel abused or ignored, and that you aren't torn apart by the pain of being what you currently are?

If it is offered ,like some consolation prize for the loser, you weren\u2019t friends after all.", "Agreed. I made this very mistake last year. It\u2019s very easy to slip into the mindset of maybe, if she keeps hanging out with you.

Since being with my now fianc\u00e9 I have been happier than I've ever been. And I was massively depressed and hung up on the same girl who was messing me around for years.\n\nIf I could go back in time knowing I had to go through all the failed dating and mental health issues and depression and being messed around, if it meant I would end up being the man that my fianc\u00e9 agreed to go on a date with and said yes to being my girlfriend and said yes to marrying me, I'd 100% go through all of it again.\n\nGranted I would rather just find her and not have to go through that, but then I wouldn't have had the dating experience, learned the do's and don't's, I wouldn't have learned what I am comfortable with and not comfortable with, what is okay and not okay to say. If I didn't have the dating experience and gone through the heartbreaks I had when I met my fianc\u00e9, I don't think she'd have wanted to be with me. I don't think I'd have been the man I was when she met me.\n\nIt is depressing, but the more you get used to it not working the more you get used to rejection or a failed date or relationship. When you get used to it it still hurts, but you learn to accept it and to learn from it much better. You recognise red flags more, you recognise traits that you're not okay with and you cut it off if a girl has a trait you're really not okay with if you recognise it. It's all life experience and it's necessary to grow as a person and to be the right person when you meet the person that is right for you.\n\nI can assure you now that the me I was before I started dating and got all that experience is not the same man I am now. I have grown much much more through those experiences. If my fianc\u00e9 was the first woman I dated, while she says she'd still be with me, she didn't know me back then. Even my friends agree with me that they don't think she'd be with me if she met me back then because I was a completely different person and not the man she is in love with now.\n\nIt's depressing going through all of this, but I can assure you it is completely and utterly worth it in the end", "Yeah, but at the same time, there seems to have been several miscommunications from both sides in this one. Although she did say from the start she wasn\u2019t looking for a serious relationship, she does admit in her post to have intentionally lead him on. She also states that in their time together, they went on \"couples activities\". I understand she said she wanted nothing serious, but her actions said otherwise. She may have done so consciously or unconsciously, but she definitely gave off mixed signals at best. I\u2019m not saying she did this on purpose, but I\u2019ve known people in the past who do these sorts of things in order to gain validation and attention from someone, but not outright date them.", "How?? She's an empathetic person, who did NOT lead him on, since she was clear and upfront about her intents that ended on casual dating, but is kind enough to feel sympathy for him and feel bad for HIS mistakes in not recognizing that. If he's been lead on, then maybe he needs to work on actually listening to women better and taking what he's been told seriously.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a (female) friend who once matched with a dude who had it in his tinder bio that he is NOT looking for a relationship, who then told her he is NOT looking for a relationship, and yet (despite apparently acknowledging this fact, telling me she's not planning on falling in love, etc) she proceeded to delete all her dating apps, fully commit her time to this guy, and drop little comments about, \"oh, haha, wouldn't it be so funny if he DID end up falling in love with her? like oh, ofc she GETS it, and she's not EXPECTING him too, but haha wouldn't it be funny?\" \n\nThen of course it ended up ending with him finally setting a boundary, even dating a different girl after, and her being obviously pretty put out by it all- but get this: it was still all HER fault. He was upfront and told her directly he is not looking for a relationship, only casual/friends, and she ignored all that to commit her time to this dude in the secret hopes of \"converting\" him. At the time I kept my diplomatic silence as her friend, but despite all the raging she did...\n\nIt was HER mistake. SHE lied to herself and others and pretended to listen to what he told her while egotistically ignoring it and expecting something different. She led HERSELF on. And it's the same here.

I understand he will never open up as much to a woman again. I've dated plenty of damaged guys. We all have a history, so instead of blaming other people for not being exactly where we WANT them to be, we need to not take it personally, and move on.

Just that she didn't want a relationship with him", "Agree to be honest.

Not to get into waving around credentials, but one thing we'd always go over in our psychology courses is how uncertain it is for people to ACTUALLY know themselves well enough to rate and report on it. A lot of times, we simply don't have the necessary insight to understand what's happening with us, we can only report the resulting symptoms.\n\nMaybe there's some problems or unattractive character traits or personality traits she doesn't want in a long-term partner that she's only registering unconsciously, and don't make it through to her awareness.  Maybe she, as she said in her post, just isn't at a point in her life where she is open to a long-term relationship, and is picking up on the growing disparity in their feelings. \n\nBut honestly, I do think what you mentioned about the logical/inexplicable reasons is the most pertinent observation here. I think it's amazing you have the emotional intelligence and insight to be able to recognize and name your reasons, and I also think it's not necessarily a common thing. For a lot of people, it can be a nebulous and hard to define thing. And I think we are also often taught to never point out other's negative traits (because that's being a dick), to only emphasize positives, and that makes it hard to later in life to face and acknowledge the things that bother us in other people.", "Well the fact that she is worried about hurting his feelings and is feeling like she led him tells me it's likely he had developed feelings.\n\nActions speak louder than words.

By and large, they are the ones initiating, approaching, looking (quite a lot), talking to, liking, DMing etc.\n\nBy and large, women are the passive part. Women's primary mating strategy is to go into contexts where they can be seen and approached by men.\n\nYou were on insta up to that point, and, you said you still have a second account, right? Were those accounts private? Meaning, nobody besides your family and closest friends maybe can actually see your pictures on insta and social media?\n\nYou have to understand that platforms like insta expose e.g. women to more men that can see them and potentially flirt and interact with them and 'approach' them than the biggest club that ever existed.\n\nFor a girl to be publicly visible on insta is as if she is standing in a 100 mil + club, surrounded by men, and she is being looked at by tens of thousands of men simultaneously. The biggest dating platform today ain't tinder or hinge or any of that.\n\nIt's instagram.\n\nThe point I am making, if you do not expose yourself in such a way because you decided that you have certain expectations concerning loyalty, then have a real talk with the man you choose. And, you should have that talk at the start of any relationship:\n\nListen, boi, I am a woman and guys will often approach me, text me and shit. Specially when I am very visible and there ain't no better way for a woman to be visible to vast numbers of men than being visible on instagram. I won't expose myself to be potentially mass approached and seen by thousands of men that see the pictures I upload, because I also wouldn't want you to do your male part of looking at thousands of women online and potentially liking their pics, DMing them, following them.\n\nYou have to understand that the male equivalent of being active, is a woman putting herself into a position where she is visible to vast numbers of men. Not talking about going shopping or to the library or in the city. In a number of contexts it isn't possible to not be seen by ppl and by men. And, you prolly will get approached.\n\nInsta and comparable platforms are on a whole other level though. For a woman to be publicly visible on those platforms means that she deliberately advertising herself to tens and hundreds of thousands of men on a scale that was never possible before.\n\nI'm very open with the girls I date. And, I told my current gf:\n\nIm not gonna look at chicks online, Im not gonna like them, follow them or DM.\n\nBut....\n\nThat comes with rules.\n\nIf I dont play my active part, then I expect you to stop with all of that as well. Being on insta, being seen by that many men. And, everybody knows why men are on insta. Women are on insta to be seen and to be validated and flirted with and primarily to be seen. Men are there to fuck. Everybody knows that.\n\nSo, if no men on those sites can see you and mass approach you and like your stuff and pics and profile and cannot DM you then in my opinion you have every right to demand the same.\n\nIn my experience though, a considerable fraction of women wants all the benefits, wants their men not to be active....while they still fully play their passive mating strategy, to then look at the guy with innocent eyes and educate that silly and jealous boy with:\n\n'dont be silly, dont be so insecure. That im visible on those platforms, that I upload pics there, that  guys can see me and that guys do like my stuff and DM me....all of that means nothing. It doenst mean anything, darling!

You don\u2019t have to say anything but if things start to get heated then you should say something and don\u2019t worry it\u2019s not awkward.\n\nI mean overall I personally recommend for people to wait and see if someone is the right person for them before sex because whether people want to admit it or not or know it or not; sex does creat a strong bond. \n\nIt\u2019s not something that can just be meaningless. That\u2019s why people are all the more heartbroken when a relationship doesn\u2019t work out; because they have a certain bond now. However that\u2019s just my opinion based on what I know.

I think having honest communication, and you can just do it by text if it's more comfortable, is a good way to move the relationship along. Explaining that you like him but you want to take things slow is a great way to open the door to good honest communication in your relationship and having him share in setting the pace for the relationship. I don't know how I would have felt when I was younger maybe, but these days, a woman communicating to me about sex is something I see is a great sign.\n\nAlso, I don't know how much it really means to say you're on your period.  I mean, if my girlfriend came over and said she was on her period, maybe we would just kiss a little or do nothing, but if she was up for it, I certainly wouldn't let that stop me. Over the years, I've probably had full sex with women that said they were on their period More than stopped at a certain point. Always consensual of course. I guess what I mean is I don't know that I've ever had a woman say she was on her period as a way of saying she didn't want to have sex. It generally is just more of a warning so that if it bothers me I wouldn't do it.

I met him through an add on Facebook for a room for rent a year ago. I met with him and did a background check and his record was clean, he seemed nice and he is a retired vet with a 12 year old son. I didn\u2019t move in with him because I had an unexpected health issue and moved back to my home state for awhile. A few weeks ago he texted me and said he still had a room for rent and I was back in the city and needed a place to go. I moved in on April 1st and it\u2019s a month to month sub lease. Also, I got home from work and told him how I felt and expressed that his advances made me uncomfortable and how I wanted to keep things professional as a roommate relationship and nothing more. He said this was fine and apologized for making it awkward and making me feel uncomfortable. He said he understands and I am choosing to believe that until I see otherwise. For those concerned with my safety, I do always have my guard up and protection on my person. I appreciate everybody\u2019s advice and even the harsh comments about me honestly, as they are just as helpful.

Stop behaving like you know everything and no one else (who doesn\u2019t agree with you) does. You asked for help multiple times, take it unashamed. People are giving reasonable and valid pieces of advice of why being with/living with people your age is helpful. \n\nAnd to be honest, for most people, it\u2019s really alot more fun. \n\nYou\u2019ve gotten yourself in a shitty, shitty situation.

(Another reason age matters!) a lot of apartments CATERED TO YOUNG PEOPLE/STUDENTS have what\u2019s called by the bed leasing. It\u2019s so you pay ONLY for what you use (generally). You pay for your bed space, you split utilities evenly with roommates and a lot of places will let you swap rooms so if something like this happens or you don\u2019t get along with your roomie(s), you can move away from them. \n\nThe guidance is HELPFUL not condescending. \n\nAGE GAPS MATTER. The most mature and successful people I have ever met in age gap relationships or living situations, are ones who KNOW THEY MATTER.

Never once did she criticize those who were wary of these things. She took their advice, and appreciated it. So now, none of those relationships are exploitive. Because instead of saying \u201cmy concern isn\u2019t about the age, it\u2019s about the apartment or consent\u201d or whatever, she said she would think about ALLLLL of those things. Age INCLUDED. And now she can pinpoint HOW she MIGHT be taken advantage of and can counter it. \n\nAnd honestly, this goes beyond age. Plenty of people our age can be exploitive and mean and immature. They just have less POWER generally to act on these things. \n\nBeing an adult is not about being right. And it\u2019s not just about being your own person and making your own decisions. \n\nIt\u2019s about doing those things while ALSO being experienced, knowledgeable, adaptable, and well-rounded.

Now a kiss might have been exagerated and caresses or trying holding hands would have been more appropriate, but i took his kiss as his actual shot, which got refused and has been followed by a clarification, to which he apologized.\n\nHonestly i just see two friends: a man who tried to approach a woman by clearly showing interest, the man got refused and he apologized if his advances made her uncomfortable after she told that.\n\nI don't see anything wrong and saying there is actually a physical safety concern is utterly paranoid from my point of view.\n\nAnyway i understand your point of view, if you don't like that situation you leave regardless of everything.", ">If he told her he liked her, she declined his advance and he took it well and stepped back then fair enough\n\nHonestly to me it looks like this is exactly what happened: made a couple of comments that showed interest, tried to kiss her and she refused, END.\n\nHe didn't repeatedly tried to get physical contact from her or kept telling her he wanted a relationship, he made a couple of moves which resulted in nothing.\n\nI think you all are so distracted by the stereotipical \"dirty old man\" that sometimes you can't see what are just simple moves from a normal person who likes another person...", "There are a lot of people (guys?) on this sub with a read similar to yours, and a lot of people (women?) who read the same post and were like \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\udea8\n\nI think the main difference was highlighted by the person above you who noted a series important power dynamic red flags: 1) massive age gap, 2) his control of her housing stability, 3) their shared space increasing his access to her, while also 4) limiting her options for rejecting him. \n\nSomething I think men fail to appreciate, and that is actively being dismissed in this thread (not necessarily by you, don't blink) is that women live in a world of threat. We could talk about how on a systemic and cultural level men have more power, or like strength or something... But more important to me right now is the individual experience where women, starting often as literal children aged 8-11, start getting routinely sexually harassed by both boys in their peer group AND grown ass men! And harassessment is the lighter end here, as many are or will be actively assaulted by all kinds of trusted individuals or people they hoped to form positive relationships with -- friends, peers, mentors, boyfriends, dates, friend's family members, their own family members, etc etc etc.  And all that experience of assault, coercion, betrayal/mistrust goes in to live on this like, spectrum -- where that spectrum of experience is informed by all the various bad shit the men around them have done to them or people they know and goes on to inform how they move through the world. \n\nWhat's more, in addition to the threat of sexual violence, women have to account for the potential for retaliatory /physical/ violence if they reject the wrong guy -- and surprise, once again the \"wrong\" guy could be any guy; your boyfriend/husband of many years, the seemingly nice stranger who started talking to you at the bar, your best friend's brother, your best friend??? And the unfortunate reality is that it's really hard to know that someone is capable of that until it happens. \n\nSo, with that being said, i think the reality of that difference in how men and women experience the same world is something important that should be taken away from this conversation. The women sounding the alarm for this child are doing so because of their own experiences and awareness of all the shitty stuff men as a general group can do. Are all men shitty? No one is saying that... but men, as a collective, can be dangerous, and this roommate has HELLA signs that he is a wolf, rather than a Labrador. And women get to a place where they learn to rely on these really subtle signs that let them know, because for them it can straight up be life and death. Where as, for our roommate here... it's a slight ego bruise, that she is even being protective of to the extent that she is considerate and trying to let him down easy etc. \n\nAnd for what it is worth, I am a trans person who is now often taken for granted as being a man when I'm living my life, so this is something that 1) I've had experience with on both sides and 2) i've spent a lot of time think about as my own appearance shifting has led to me being treated/approached differently over time.

Further, he attempted to kiss her after getting zero confirmation that she wanted anything like that from him, while she was in the house with him and couldn\u2019t get away. \n\nThis isn\u2019t flirting while out at the bar or something where the woman could feel relatively safe saying no and leaving. \n\nAnd no, it\u2019s not her fault for \u201cbeing stupid\u201d.

I had my first kiss soon afterward, and finally lost my virginity a couple months afterward.  Growing up, I was always intimidated by the idea of dating, but to my surprise, I found I was completely relaxed, the conversations flowed, and most of the women seemed generally interested in me.\n\nAfter this initial phase, I thought I had a breakthrough... but after 40 years of conditioning, I kept relapsing - I actually have a good time when I go on dates, but it's extremely hard to put myself out there.  As a result, I rarely go on dates, and I've only been in two relationships (3 months each), and have had sex a total of nine times in my life.  \n\nI think a lot of this hesitation is due to my lack of experience in romantic/intimate matters.  On paper, everything checks the box for me, and for the first couple dates when we're just hanging out and doing stuff, I think I come across as a pretty cool guy.  But, once things start to get intimate, I think women pick up that there is something \"off\" about me - I won't know how to respond to things like sexy phone photos or sexting, there's a certain awkwardness and lack of confidence in my actions -  and I think a mature, experienced woman in her mid/late 30's to mid-40's pick up on this immediately.  The worst was the last relationship I was in - it wasn't perfect, but it was going OK.  We had sex about two months in.  Unfortunately, the sex wasn't good mainly due to my fumbling lack of experience and smoothness, and it was extremely embarrassing for me.  She broke off the relationship shortly afterward.  Perhaps there were other factors too, but I would be surprised if the shitty sex wasn't a contributing factor.  \n\nThat was 10 months ago.  I have not dated or talked to any woman since then, but I'm finally working up the nerve to start again.  I am trying to figure out what I can do differently.  I think the issue is that of expectations.  By a certain age, certain things are expected of you, or you're abnormal.  By my age, I'm expected to have things like a nice job, financial security, worldly knowledge and wisdom, and a certain level of experience and proficiency in the bedroom.  Since I have all the things that are outwardly visible, I think they get confused and then turned off when they finally discover the one thing they can't see from the outside because it's so unexpected. \n\nI'm obviously sensitive to my lack of experience, so I'd asked some female friends before I started dating, whether I should be upfront with this.  Unanimously, they told me not to disclose and let things progress naturally and work themselves out.  I am now thinking this is not the right approach.  It's a \"fake it till you make it\" approach that sets up false expectations that I can't meet (eventually with enough experience I'm confident I can, but I'm just not there yet).  I also think it's dishonest - knowing that a woman will incorrectly assume I'm proficient based on all the other things I'm doing right, and letting her believe this falsehood and leading her on, is a form a lying and false advertisement.  I feel it's not fair to do this to a woman.  \n\nObviously, I wouldn't just blurt it out or give her a long-winded story of my life or whatever, but I do think I need to disclose my lack of experience and set a reasonable expectation - for both her as well as myself.  But, this seems like a very awkward conversation to have that could kill her romantic feelings for me.  When do you have this conversation?  Would it turn her away?  Will I turn it into a self-fulfilling prophesy since she'll get the idea stuck in her mind that I suck at sex?  Will she interpret it as a sign of insecurity on my part?  Will she just think I'm an abnormal weirdo for being such a late bloomer?  \n\nI'm probably overthinking this, but I can't tell if all this thinking isolated in my own headspace is leading me down a bunch of rabbit holes; some outside perspective would be much appreciated.", "id": "13337vw", "upvotes": 1, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/13337vw/inexperienced_45yo_male_when_and_how_to_disclose/", "permalink": "/r/dating_advice/comments/13337vw/inexperienced_45yo_male_when_and_how_to_disclose/", "comments": ["It's completely understandable that you feel nervous and unsure about dating and intimacy given your lack of experience, but it's important to remember that everyone has their own unique journey when it comes to relationships and sexuality. You're not abnormal or weird for being a late bloomer - it's just a different path than what society expects.\r  \n\r  \nFirst and foremost, it's important to be honest with yourself about your comfort level and what you're looking for in a relationship. If you're not ready to engage in sexual activity yet, that's perfectly okay. There's no need to rush or push yourself into anything that makes you uncomfortable.\r  \n\r  \nWhen it comes to disclosure, it's ultimately up to you to decide when and how you want to have that conversation. If you feel like you want to be upfront about your lack of experience, you can bring it up when the time feels right. It doesn't have to be a long-winded explanation - a simple statement like \"I just wanted to let you know that I don't have a lot of experience with relationships and intimacy\" can suffice. You can then follow up with a conversation about what you're comfortable with and what your expectations are.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it's possible that some women may be turned off by your lack of experience, it's important to remember that everyone has their own preferences and priorities when it comes to relationships. Some women may appreciate your honesty and willingness to communicate, while others may not. It's not a reflection on you as a person, but rather a matter of compatibility.\r  \n\r  \nIt's also worth noting that sexual compatibility can be developed and improved over time with practice and communication. It's not necessarily a deal-breaker if the first few times aren't great - what's important is that you're open to feedback and willing to learn and grow together.\r  \n\r  \nUltimately, the most important thing is to be true to yourself and communicate openly and honestly with your partner. Good luck!", "Thank you, I appreciate your thoughtful, sensitive comments.\n\nI have to disagree with your comment on late bloomer being not abnormal... +40 virgins are 0.3% of men, and the majority of that 0.3% is due to religious beliefs, which doesn't apply to me.. so figure non-religious +40 virgins are 0.1% of men, which would make me literally one out of a thousand or less... which is statistically abnormal..  I appreciate your positive words, but I can't ignore fact.  The absurd thing is, I'm mature enough to recognize intellectually that this statistic doesn't mean a thing, but emotionally, it's a hard one to shake.\n\nI do agree that the comfort level is important.  After I broke up with my first relationship ever, I tried to give the casual thing a chance, and had two one-night stands.  I knew right away it wasn't worth it for me; I haven't pursued any since, and have no desire to either.  I was so drunk I barely remember the experience, and I wouldn't even recognize the girls if I walked past them in the street.  While I have nothing against various activities between consenting single adults, I don't see any appeal in it for myself.  I think I'm looking for a genuine emotional partner, a best friend with the bond strengthened by physical intimacy.  Perhaps this is overly idealized and romanticized because of my lack of experience, but it is what it is...\n\nI really appreciate your comment on rejection being not a \"reflection on  your as a person, rather than compatibility.\"  Very insightful - I'd never thought of it this way before, I assumed I'd done something wrong and botched it.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t say all men.

If you've been dating for a while and he just asks if you could on a hard week or two when he normally pays for things, that's not really all that bad either.  If he's asking you to pay your portion, there are a couple considerations.  Do you make more than him?  Is he in a place right now to be spending a whole ton of money for your part on dates?

Maybe I just wasn't cut out for dating? \n\nI should REALLY emphasize that I gave up. I stopped caring for myself and deleted dating apps. I actively avoided any kind of romantic advances made to me. I didn't even go outside much. It stayed like this for 2 years.\n\nFinancially I'm decent, but I decided for a side hustle I'd make erotica (again, why not?? Who am I impressing exactly lol). I am pretty good at writing so I wrote some smut and peddled it. People liked it, cool. No big deal. \n\nFast forward to a few months later and I'm a relatively big fish in my small pond of smut peddling. Then I meet a girl. She is sweet, and dealing with things im dealing with and relate too. She is kind to me, something I'm not really used too. And WOW is she crushing on me. I think she is cute too and I love how supportive and sweet she is. \n\nThe problem is that she is 22. \n\nI feel guilty with such a huge age gap and such an obvious difference in life experiance between us. Honestly it makes me feel like some kind of predator? Then I feel like I'm infantalizing a grown woman with a job and a life outside of me and? I'm not sure which is the worst option??\n\nI have told her repeatedly there's no rush and i support her best I can, but it's been a long time since I've felt like this about someone. We spend hours talking about nonsense and she genuinely makes me happy. She makes me laugh, and I can talk to her freely and really feel like I'm being heard. \n\nAm I being dumb? If so, in what way? I genuinely want to take care of her and I really enjoy her unique personality, but my age makes me feel like I'm some kind of shark dealing with an almost decade age difference.\n\nI didn't even WANT this which is the real kicker, I just wanted to write garbage and be left alone and here I am lol.", "id": "12qx6ix", "upvotes": 2, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/12qx6ix/how_awful_am_i_scale_from_110/", "permalink": "/r/dating_advice/comments/12qx6ix/how_awful_am_i_scale_from_110/", "comments": ["For context, my two closest friends (whose opinions I respect a lot and generally align with) both think I'm overly leery of age gap relationships.\n\nI don't think you're a creep.

Since I'm close to reaching the 75 unit maximum for being Undeclared, I cannot take the prerequisite Math/Chemistry/Biology lower division requirements in time to declare Biology as my major.
